[[File:SUEWS_Overview_s.png|frame|right|
Overview of SUEWS]]

<!--T:4-->
Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme ('''SUEWS''') (Järvi et al. 2011<ref name="J11">Järvi L, Grimmond CSB & Christen A (2011) The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS): Evaluation in Los Angeles and Vancouver. J. Hydrol. 411, 219-237.</ref>, Ward et al. 2016<ref name="W16">Ward HC, Kotthaus S, Järvi L and Grimmond CSB 2016: Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS): development and evaluation at two UK sites. Urban Climate. 18, 1-32 [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2016.05.001 doi: 10.1016/j.uclim.2016.05.001]</ref>) is able to simulate the urban radiation, energy and water balances using only commonly measured meteorological variables and information about the surface cover. SUEWS utilizes an evaporation-interception approach (Grimmond et al. 1991<ref name="G91">Grimmond CSB & Oke TR (1991) An Evaporation-Interception Model for Urban Areas. Water Resour. Res. 27, 1739-1755. </ref>), similar to that used in forests, to model evaporation from urban surfaces. 

<!--T:5-->
[[File:SUEWS_SurfaceWaterBalance_v2_xxs.jpg|frame|right|
The seven surface types considered in SUEWS]]

<!--T:6-->
The model uses seven surface types: paved, buildings, evergreen trees/shrubs, deciduous trees/shrubs, grass, bare soil and water. The surface state for each surface type at each time step is calculated from the running water balance of the canopy where the evaporation is calculated from the Penman-Monteith equation. The soil moisture below each surface type (excluding water) is taken into account. 

<!--T:7-->
Horizontal movement of water above and below ground level is allowed. The user can specify the model time-step, but 5 min is strongly recommended. The main output file is provided at a resolution of 60 min by default. The model provides the radiation and energy balance components, surface and soil wetness, surface and soil runoff and the drainage for each surface. Timestamps refer to the end of the averaging period.

Model applicability: SUEWS is a neighbourhood-scale or local-scale model.

== SUEWS and UMEP ==

SUEWS can be run as a standalone model but also can be used within [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual UMEP]. There are numerous tools included within UMEP to help a user get started. The [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Urban_Energy_Balance:_Urban_Energy_Balance_.28SUEWS.2C_simple.29 SUEWS simple] within UMEP is a fast way to start using SUEWS.

The version of SUEWS within UMEP is the complete model. Thus all options that are listed in this manual are available to the user. In the UMEP [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Urban_Energy_Balance:_Urban_Energy_Balance_.28SUEWS.2C_simple.29 SUEWS simple] runs all options are set to values to allow intial exploration of the model behaviour.

The version of SUEWS within UMEP is a more recent release of the model than the independent SUEWS release.

==Parameterisations and sub-models within SUEWS== <!--T:8-->

===Net all-wave radiation, Q* === <!--T:10-->
There are several options for modelling or using observed radiation components depending on the data available. As a minimum, SUEWS requires incoming shortwave radiation to be provided.
#Observed net all-wave radiation can be provided as input instead of being calculated by the model.
#Observed incoming shortwave and incoming longwave components can be provided as input, instead of incoming longwave being calculated by the model.
#Other data can be provided as input, such as cloud fraction (see options in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl]]).
#'''NARP''' (Net All-wave Radiation Parameterization, Offerle et al. 2003<ref name="O2003"> Offerle B, Grimmond CSB & Oke TR (2003) Parameterization of Net All-Wave Radiation for Urban Areas. J. Appl. Meteorol. 42, 1157-1173.</ref> , Loridan et al. 2011<ref name="L2011"> Loridan T, CSB Grimmond, BD Offerle, DT Young, T Smith, L Järvi, F Lindberg (2011) Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS): longwave radiation parameterization & seasonality related developments. Journal of Applied Meteorology & Climatology 50, 185-202, doi: 10.1175/2010JAMC2474.1</ref> ) scheme calculates outgoing shortwave and incoming and outgoing longwave radiation components based on incoming shortwave radiation, temperature, relative humidity and surface characteristics (albedo, emissivity).

===Anthropogenic heat flux, Q<sub>F</sub> === <!--T:14-->

<!--T:15-->
#Two simple anthropogenic heat flux sub-models exist within SUEWS: 
#*Järvi et al. (2011)<ref name="J11"/> approach, based on heating and cooling degree days and population density (allows distinction between weekdays and weekends).
#*Loridan et al. (2011)<ref name="L2011"/> approach, based on a linear piece-wise relation with air temperature.
#Pre-calculated values can be supplied with the meteorological forcing data, either derived from knowledge of the study site, or obtained from other models, for example:
#* '''LUCY''' (Allen et al. 2011<ref name=lucy/>, Lindberg et al. 2013<ref name=lucy2/>). A new version has been now included in UMEP. To distinguish it is referred to as [http://urban-climate.net/umep/LQF_Manual '''LQF'''] 
#* '''GreaterQF''' (Iamarino et al. 2011<ref name="I11"> Iamarino M, Beevers S & Grimmond CSB (2011) High-resolution (space, time) anthropogenic heat emissions: London 1970-2025. International J. of Climatology. 32, 1754-1767.</ref>). A new version has been now included in UMEP. To distinguish it is referred to as [http://urban-climate.net/umep/GQF_Manual '''GQF''']

===Storage heat flux, ΔQ<sub>S</sub>=== <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
#Three sub-models are available to estimate the storage heat flux:
#*'''OHM''' (Objective Hysteresis Model, Grimmond et al. 1991<ref name="G91OHM"> Grimmond CSB, Cleugh HA & Oke TR (1991) An objective urban heat storage model and its comparison with other schemes. Atmos. Env. 25B, 311-174.</ref>, Grimmond & Oke 1999a<ref name="GO99QS">Grimmond CSB & Oke TR (1999a) Heat storage in urban areas: Local-scale observations and evaluation of a simple model. J. Appl. Meteorol. 38, 922-940.</ref>, 2002<ref name="GO2002"> Grimmond CSB & Oke TR (2002) Turbulent Heat Fluxes in Urban Areas: Observations and a Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS) J. Appl. Meteorol. 41, 792-810.</ref>). Storage heat heat flux is calculated using empirically-fitted relations with net all-wave radiation and the rate of change in net all-wave radiation. 
#*'''AnOHM''' (Analytical Objective Hysteresis Model, Sun et al. 2017<ref name="AnOHM17"> Sun T, Wang ZH, Oechel W & Grimmond CSB (2017) The Analytical Objective Hysteresis Model (AnOHM v1.0): Methodology to Determine Bulk Storage Heat Flux Coefficients. Geosci. Model Dev. Discuss. doi: 10.5194/gmd-2016-300.</ref>). OHM approach using analytically-derived  coefficients. ('''Not recommended in v2017b''')
#*'''ESTM''' (Element Surface Temperature Method, Offerle et al. 2005<ref name="Oaf2005"> Offerle B, CSB Grimmond, K Fortuniak (2005) Heat storage & anthropogenic heat flux in relation to the energy balance of a central European city center. International J. of Climatology. 25: 1405–1419 doi: 10.1002/joc.1198</ref>). Heat transfer through urban facets (roof, wall, road, interior) is calculated from surface temperature measurements and knowledge of material properties. ('''Not recommended in v2017b''')
#Alternatively, 'observed' storage heat flux can be supplied with the meteorological forcing data.

===Turbulent heat fluxes,  Q<sub>H</sub> and Q<sub>E</sub> === <!--T:20-->
#'''LUMPS''' (Local-scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme, Grimmond & Oke 2002<ref name="GO2002"/>) provides a simple means of estimating sensible and latent heat fluxes based on the proportion of vegetation in the study area.
#'''SUEWS''' adopts a more biophysical approach to calculate the latent heat flux; the sensible heat flux is then calculated as the residual of the energy balance. The initial estimate of stability is based on the LUMPS calculations of sensible and latent heat flux. Future versions will have alternative sensible heat and storage heat flux options.

Sensible and latent heat fluxes from both LUMPS and SUEWS are provided in the [[#Output files|model output]]. Whether the turbulent heat fluxes are calculated using LUMPS or SUEWS can have a major impact on the results. For SUEWS, an appropriate surface conductance parameterisation is also critical<ref name="J11"/><ref name="W16"/>. For more details see [[#Differences between SUEWS, LUMPS and FRAISE|Differences between SUEWS, LUMPS and FRAISE]].

===Water balance=== <!--T:23-->
The running water balance at each time step is based on the urban water balance model of Grimmond et al. (1986)<ref name="G86">Grimmond CSB, Oke TR and Steyn DG (1986) Urban water-balance 1. A model for daily totals. Water Resour Res 22: 1397-1403.</ref> and urban evaporation-interception scheme of Grimmond and Oke (1991)<ref name="G91"/>. 
*Precipitation is a required variable in the meteorological forcing file.
*Irrigation can be modelled<ref name="J11"/> or observed values can be provided if data are available.
*Drainage equations and coefficients to use must be specified in the input files. 
*Soil moisture can be calculated by the model ('''Use of observed soil moisture is not possible in v2017b'''). 
*Runoff is permitted:
**between surface types within each model grid
**between model grids ('''Not implemented in v2017b''')
**to deep soil
**to pipes.

===Snowmelt=== <!--T:25-->
The snowmelt model within SUEWS is described in Järvi et al. (2014)<ref name="Leena2014">Järvi L, Grimmond CSB, Taka M, Nordbo A, Setälä H & Strachan IB (2014) Development of the Surface Urban Energy and Water balance Scheme (SUEWS) for cold climate cities, Geosci. Model Dev. 7, 1691-1711, doi:10.5194/gmd-7-1691-2014.</ref>. Due to changes in the new model version (since v2016a) when compared to the older versions, the snow calculation has slightly changed. The main difference is that previously all surface state could freeze in  1-h time step but now the amount of freezing surface state is calculated similar way as melt water can freeze within the snow pack. Also the snowmelt-related coefficients have slightly changed (see [[#SUEWS_Snow.txt|SUEWS_Snow.txt]]).

===Convective boundary layer=== <!--T:24-->
A convective boundary layer (CBL) slab model (Cleugh and Grimmond 2001<ref name="CG2001"> Cleugh HA & Grimmond CSB (2001) Modelling regional scale surface energy exchanges and CBL growth in a heterogeneous, urban-rural landscape. Bound.-Layer Meteor. 98, 1-31.</ref>) calculates the CBL height, temperature and humidity during daytime (Onomura et al. 2015<ref name="Shiho2015"> Onomura S, Grimmond CSB, Lindberg F, Holmer B & Thorsson S (2015) Meteorological forcing data for urban outdoor thermal comfort models from a coupled convective boundary layer and surface energy balance scheme Urban Climate,11, 1-23 doi:10.1016/j.uclim.2014.11.001</ref>).

===Thermal comfort===
'''SOLWEIG''' (Solar and longwave environmental irradiance geometry model, Lindberg et al. 2008<ref name="FL2008"> Lindberg F, Holmer B & Thorsson S (2008) SOLWEIG 1.0 – Modelling spatial variations of 3D radiant fluxes and mean radiant temperature in complex urban settings. International Journal of Biometeorology 52, 697–713.</ref>, Lindberg and Grimmond 2011<ref name="FL2011"> Lindberg F & Grimmond C (2011) The influence of vegetation and building morphology on shadow patterns and mean radiant temperature in urban areas: model development and evaluation. Theoretical and Applied Climatology 105:3, 311-323.</ref>) is a 2D radiation model to estimate mean radiant temperature.

==Preparing to run the model== <!--T:29-->
The following is to help with the model setup.
Note that there is a version of SUEWS in [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual UMEP] and there are some starting [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Tutorials tutorials] for that. The version there is the same (i.e. the executable) as the standalone version so you can swap to that later once you have some familiarity.

(+) There is a second file InitialConditionsSSss_YYYY_EndOfRun.nml or InitialConditionsSSss_YYYY+1.nml in the input directory. At the end of the run, and at the end of each year of the run, these files are written out so that this information could be used to initialize further model runs.

===Run the model for example data=== <!--T:37-->
Before running the model for your own data it is good to make certain that you can run the test data and get the same results as in the example files provided. It is recommended that you make a copy of the example output files and put them somewhere else so you can compare the results. When you run the program it will write over the supplied files.

<!--T:39-->
To run the model you can use '''Command Prompt''' (in the directory where the programme is located type the model name) or just double click the executable file. 

<!--T:38-->
Please see [[#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]]  if you have problems running the model.

===Preparation of data=== <!--T:40-->
This section describes the information required to run SUEWS for your site. The input data can be summarised as follows:
#Continuous ''meteorological forcing data'' for the entire period to be modelled. Note you can not have gaps in the meteorological data. If you need help with preparing the data you may want to use some of the tools in [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Meteorological_Data:_MetPreprocessor UMEP].
#Knowledge of the ''surface and soil conditions immediately before the start of the run'' (if these initial conditions are not known, it is usually possible to determine suitable values by running the model and using the output at the end of the run to infer the conditions at the start of the run).
#The ''location of the site'' (latitude, longitude, altitude).
#Information about the ''characteristics of the surface'', including land cover, heights of buildings and trees, radiative characteristics (e.g. albedo, emissivity), drainage characteristics, soil characteristics, snow characteristics, phenological characteristics (e.g. seasonal cycle of LAI).
#Information about ''human behaviour'', including energy use and water use (e.g. for irrigation or street cleaning) and snow clearing (if applicable). The anthropogenic energy use and water use may be provided as a time series in the meteorological forcing file if these data are available or modelled based on parameters provided to the model, including population density, hourly and weekly profiles of energy and water use, information about the proportion of properties using irrigation and the type of irrigation (automatic or manual).

It is particularly important to ensure the following input information is appropriate and representative of the site:
*Fractions of different land cover types and (less so) heights of buildings<ref name="W16"/>
*Accurate meteorological forcing data, particularly precipitation and incoming shortwave radiation<ref name="Ko17"> Kokkonen TV, Grimmond CSB, Räty O, Ward HC, Christen A, Oke TR, Kotthaus S & Järvi L (in review) Sensitivity of Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) to downscaling of reanalysis forcing data. </ref>
*Initial soil moisture conditions<ref name="Best2014"> Best MJ & Grimmond CSB (2014) Importance of initial state and atmospheric conditions for urban land surface models’ performance. Urban Climate 10: 387-406. doi: 10.1016/j.uclim.2013.10.006. </ref>
*Anthropogenic heat flux parameters, particularly if there are considerable energy emissions from transport, buildings, metabolism, etc<ref name="W16"/>
*External water use (if irrigation or street cleaning occurs)
*Snow clearing (if running the snow option)
*Surface conductance parameterisation<ref name="J11"/><ref name="W16"/>

SUEWS can be run either for an individual area or for multiple areas. There is no requirement for the areas to be of any particular shape but here we refer to them as model 'grids'.

====Preparation of site characteristics and model parameters====<!--T:41-->
The area to be modelled is described by a set of characteristics that are specified in the [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]] file. Each row corresponds to one model grid for one year (i.e. running a single grid over three years would require three rows; running two grids over two years would require four rows). Characteristics are often selected by a code for a particular set of conditions. For example, a specific soil type (links to [[#SUEWS_Soil.txt|SUEWS_Soil.txt]]) or characteristics of deciduous trees in a particular region (links to [[#SUEWS_Veg.txt|SUEWS_Veg.txt]]). The intent is to build a library of characteristics for different types of urban areas. The codes are specified by the user, must be integer values and must be unique within the first column of each input file, otherwise the model will return an error. (Note in [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]] the first column is labelled 'Grid' and can contain repeat values for different years.) See [[#Input files|Input files]] for details.
Note [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP UMEP] maybe helpful for components of this.


=====Land cover=====

<!--T:42-->
For each grid, the land cover must be classified using the following surface types:

<!--T:43-->
{| class="wikitable"
!Classification 
!Surface type   
!File where characteristics are specified
|- 
|Non-vegetated ||Paved surfaces || [[#SUEWS_NonVeg.txt|SUEWS_NonVeg.txt]]
|-  
| ||Building surfaces || [[#SUEWS_NonVeg.txt|SUEWS_NonVeg.txt]]
|- 
| ||Bare soil surfaces || [[#SUEWS_NonVeg.txt|SUEWS_NonVeg.txt]]
|- 
| Vegetation ||Evergreen trees and shrubs || [[#SUEWS_Veg.txt|SUEWS_Veg.txt]]
|-
| ||Deciduous trees and shrubs || [[#SUEWS_Veg.txt|SUEWS_Veg.txt]]
|-
||  ||Grass || [[#SUEWS_Veg.txt|SUEWS_Veg.txt]]
|-
||Water ||Water || [[#SUEWS_Water.txt|SUEWS_Water.txt]]
|-
|Snow||Snow ||  [[#SUEWS_Snow.txt|SUEWS_Snow.txt]]
|-
|}

<!--T:44-->
The surface cover fractions (i.e. proportion of the grid taken up by each surface) must be specified in [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]]. The surface cover fractions are '''critical''', so make certain that the different surface cover fractions are appropriate for your site.

For some locations, land cover information may be already available (e.g. from various remote sensing resources). If not, websites like Bing Maps and Google Maps allow you to see aerial images of your site and can be used to estimate the relative proportion of each land cover type.
If detailed spatial datasets are available, [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP UMEP] allows for a direct link to a GIS environment using QGIS.

=====Anthropogenic heat flux (Q<sub>F</sub>)===== <!--T:45-->
You can either model Q<sub>F</sub> within SUEWS or provide it as an input.
*To model it population density is needed as an input for LUMPS and SUEWS to calculate Q<sub>F</sub>. 
*If you have no information about the population of the site we recommend that you use the LUCY model<ref name=lucy> Allen L, F Lindberg, CSB Grimmond (2011) Global to city scale model for anthropogenic heat flux, International Journal of Climatology, 31, 1990-2005.</ref> <ref name=lucy2>Lindberg F, Grimmond CSB, Nithiandamdan Y, Kotthaus S, Allen L (2013) Impact of city changes and weather on anthropogenic heat flux in Europe 1995–2015, Urban Climate,4,1-13 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2013.03.002 paper]</ref> to estimate the anthropogenic heat flux which can then be provided as input SUEWS along with the meteorological forcing data. The LUCY model can be downloaded from [http://micromet.reading.ac.uk/ here].

Alternatively, you can use the updated version of LUCY called [http://urban-climate.net/umep/LQF_Manual LQF], which is included in [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP UMEP].

=====Other information=====
The surface cover fractions and population density can have a major impact on the model output. However, it is important to consider the suitability of all parameters for your site. Using inappropriate parameters may result in the model returning an error or, worse, generating output that is simply not representative of your site. Please read the section on [[#Input files|Input files]]. Recommended or reasonable ranges of values are suggested for some parameters, along with important considerations for how to select appropriate values for your site.

=====Data Entry===== <!--T:46-->
To create the series of input text files describing the characteristics of your site, there are three options:
# Data can be entered directly into the input text files. The example (.txt) files provide a template to create your own files which can be edited with a [[#A text editor|text editor]] directly.
# Data can be entered into the spreadsheet '''SUEWS_SiteInfo.xlsm''' and the input text files generated by running the macro. 
# Use [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP| UMEP].

'''To run the xlsm macro:''' <!--T:47-->
Enter the data for your site into the xlsm spreadsheet '''SUEWS_SiteInfo.xlsm''' and then use the macro to create the text files which will appear the same directory.

<!--T:50-->
If there is a problem
*Make sure none of the text files to be generated are open. 
*It is recommended to close the spreadsheet before running the actual model code. 

<!--T:52-->
Note that in all txt files:
*The first two rows are headers. The first row is the column number; the second row is the column name.
*The names and order of the columns should not be altered from the templates, as these are checked by the model and errors will be returned if particular columns cannot be found.
*Since v2017a it is no longer necessary for the meteorological forcing data to have two rows with -9 in column 1 as their last two rows. 
*“!” indicates a comment, so any text following "!" on the same line will not be read by the model.
*If data are unavailable or not required, enter the value -999 in the correct place in the input file.
*Ensure the units are correct for all input information. See [[#Input files|Input files]] for a description of parameters.

<!--T:53-->
In addition to these text files, the following files are also needed to run the model.

====Preparation of the RunControl file====
In the RunControl.nml file the site name (SS_) and directories for the model input and output are given. 
This means '''before running''' the model (even the with the example datasets) you must either
#open the RunControl.nml file and edit the input and output file paths and the site name (with a [[#A text editor|text editor]]) so that they are correct for your setup, or
#create the directories specified in the RunControl.nml file

<!--T:56-->
From the given site identification the model identifies the input files and generates the output files.  
For example if you specify 
 '''FileOutputPath = “C:\FolderName\SUEWSOutput\”''' and use site code SS the model creates an output file 
 '''C:\FolderName\SUEWSOutput\SSss_YYYY_TT.txt''' (remember to add the last backslash in windows and slash in Linux/Mac).

<!--T:57-->
If the file paths are not correct the program will return an error when run (see [[#Error messages: problems.txt|error messages]]) and write the error to the problems.txt file.

====Preparation of the Meteorological forcing data==== <!--T:58-->
The model time-step is specified in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]] (5 min is highly recommended). If meteorological forcing data are not available at this resolution, SUEWS has the option to downscale (e.g. hourly) data to the time-step required. See details about the [[#SSss_YYYY_data_tt.txt|meteorological forcing data]] to learn more about choices of data input. Each grid can have its own meteorological forcing file, or a single file can be used for all grids. The forcing data should be representative of the local-scale, i.e. collected (or derived) above the height of the roughness elements (buildings and trees).

====Preparation of the InitialConditions file==== <!--T:59-->
Information about the surface state and meteorological conditions just before the start of the run are provided in the Initial Conditions file. At the very start of the run, each grid can have its own Initial Conditions file, or a single file can be used for all grids. For details see [[#InitialConditions|InitialConditions]].

===Run the model for your site===<!--T:60-->
To run the model you can use '''Command Prompt''' (in the directory where the programme is located type the model name) or just double click the executable file. 

<!--T:62-->
Please see [[#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]]  if you have problems running the model.

===Analyse the output===<!--T:63-->
It is a good idea to perform initial checks that the model output looks reasonable.

<!--T:64-->
{|class="wikitable"
!Characteristic
!Things to check
|-
|Leaf area index
|Does the phenology look appropriate (i.e. what does the seasonal cycle of [http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Leaf_area_index leaf area index (LAI)] look like?)
*Are the leaves on the trees at approximately the right time of the year? 
|-
|Kdown
|Is the timing of the diurnal cycle correct for the incoming solar radiation? 
*Although Kdown is a required input, it is also included in the output file. It is a good idea to check that the timing of Kdown in the output file is appropriate, as problems can indicate errors with the timestamp, incorrect time settings or problems with the disaggregation. In particular, make sure the sign of the longitude is specified correctly in [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]].
*Checking solar angles (zenith and azimuth) can also be a useful check that the timing is correct.
|-
|Albedo
|Is the bulk albedo correct?
*This is critical because a small error has an impact on all the fluxes (energy and hydrology).
*If you have measurements of outgoing shortwave radiation compare these with the modelled values.
*How do the values compare to literature values for your area?
|-
|}

===Summary of files=== <!--T:73-->
The table below lists the files required to run SUEWS and the output files produced. SS is the two-letter code (specified in RunControl) representing the site name, ss is the grid identification (integer values between 0 and 2,147,483,647 (largest 4-byte integer)) and YYYY is the year. TT is the resolution of the input/output file and tt is the model time-step.

The last column indicates whether the files are needed/produced once per run (1/run), or once per day (1/day), for each year (1/year) or for each grid (1/grid). 

 [B] indicates files used with the CBL part of SUEWS (BLUEWS) and therefore are only needed/produced if this option is selected
 [E] indicates files associated with ESTM storage heat flux models and therefore are only needed/produced if this option is selected

SUEWS allows you to input a large number of parameters to describe the characteristics of your site. You should not assume that the example values provided in files or in the tables below are appropriate. Values marked with 'MD' are examples of recommended values (see the suggested references to help decide how appropriate these are for your site/model domain); values marked with 'MU' need to be set (i.e. changed from the example) for your site/model domain.

===RunControl.nml=== <!--T:84-->
The file '''RunControl.nml''' is a namelist that specifies the options for the model run. It must be located in the same directory as the executable file.

The format should be: 

 <!--T:85-->

====SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt==== <!--T:89-->
For each year and each grid, site specific surface cover information and other input parameters is provided to SUEWS by '''SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt'''. The model currently requires a new row for each year of the model run. All rows in this file (before the two rows of '-9') will be read by the model and run. In this file the '''column order is important'''. '!' can be used to indicate comments in the file. Comments are not read by the programme so they can be used by the user to provide notes for their interpretation of the contents. This is strongly recommended.

=====Day Light Savings (DLS)===== <!--T:101-->
The dates for DLS normally vary each year and country as they are often associated with a specific set of Sunday mornings at the beginning of summer and autumn. Note it is important to remember leap years. You can check http://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/ for your city.

<!--T:102-->
If DLS does not occur give a start and end day immediately after it. Make certain the dummy dates are correct for the hemisphere:
 for northern hemisphere, use: 180 181
 for southern hemisphere, use:  365 1

=====Grid Connections (water flow between grids)===== <!--T:105-->

'''N.B. not currently implemented''' - columns 64-79 of [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]] can be set to zero.

<!--T:107-->
This section gives an example of water flow between grids, calculated based on the relative elevation of the grids and length of the connecting surface between adjacent grids. For the square grids in the figure, water flow is assumed to be zero between diagonally adjacent grids, as the length of connecting surface linking the grids is very small. Model grids need not be square or the same size. 

<!--T:108-->
The table gives example values for the grid connections part of [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]] for the grids shown in the figure. For each row, only water flowing out of the current grid is entered (e.g. water flows from 234 to 236 and 237, with a larger proportion of water flowing to 237 because of the greater length of connecting surface between 234 and 237 than between 234 and 236. No water is assumed to flow between 234 and 233 or 235 because there is no elevation difference between these grids. Grids 234 and 238 are at the same elevation and only connect at a point, so no water flows between them. Water enters grid 234 from grids 230, 231 and 232 as these are more elevated.

If the soil characteristics are assumed to be the same for all surface types, use a single code value to link the characteristics here with the SoilTypeCode columns in [[#SUEWS_NonVeg.txt|SUEWS_NonVeg.txt]] and [[#SUEWS_Veg.txt|SUEWS_Veg.txt]].   

<!--T:173-->
Soil moisture can either be provided using observational data in the met forcing file (smd_choice = 1 or 2 in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]]) and providing some metadata information here (OBS_ columns), or modelled by SUEWS (smd_choice = 0 in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]]).

====SUEWS_Irrigation.txt==== <!--T:189-->
SUEWS includes a simple model for external water use if observed data are not available. The model calculates daily water use from the mean daily air temperature, number of days since rain and fraction of irrigated area using automatic/manual irrigation. The sub-daily pattern of water use is modelled according to the daily cycles specified in [[#SUEWS_Profiles.txt|SUEWS_Profiles.txt]].

<!--T:190-->
Alternatively, if available, the external water use can be provided in the met forcing file (and set WaterUseMethod = 1 in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]]), in which case all columns here except Code should be set to '-999'.

====SUEWS_Profiles.txt==== <!--T:191-->
SUEWS_Profiles.txt specifies the daily cycle of variables related to human behaviour (energy use, water use and snow clearing). Different profiles can be specified for weekdays and weekends. The profiles are provided at hourly resolution here; the model will then interpolate the hourly energy and water use profiles to the resolution of the model time step and normalize the values provided. Thus it does not matter whether columns 2-25 add up to, say 1, 24, or another number, because the model will handle this. Currently, the snow clearing profiles are not interpolated as these are effectively a switch (0 or 1).

<!--T:192-->
If the anthropogenic heat flux and water use are specified in the met forcing file, the energy and water use profiles are not used.
 
Profiles are specified for the following
*Anthropogenic heat flux (weekday and weekend)
*Water use (weekday and weekend; manual and automatic irrigation)
*Snow removal (weekday and weekend)
*Human activity (weekday and weekend) '''- not used in v2017a'''.

====SUEWS_WithinGridWaterDist.txt==== <!--T:195-->
SUEWS_WithinGridWaterDist.txt specifies the movement of water between surfaces within a grid/area. It allows impervious connectivity to be taken into account.

<!--T:196-->
Each row corresponds to a surface type (linked by the Code in column 1 to the [[#SiteSelect.txt|SiteSelect.txt]] columns: WithinGridPavedCode, WithinGridBldgsCode, …, WithinGridWaterCode). Each column contains the fraction of water flowing from the surface type to each of the other surface types or to runoff or the sub-surface soil store.
 
Note:
* The sum of each row (excluding the Code) must equal 1.
* Water cannot flow from one surface to that same surface, so the diagonal elements should be zero. 
* The row corresponding to the water surface should be zero, as there is currently no flow permitted from the water surface to other surfaces by the model.
* Currently water '''cannot''' go to both runoff and soil store (i.e. it must go to one or the other – runoff for impervious surfaces; soilstore for pervious surfaces).

<!--T:197-->
In the table below, for example,
* all flow from paved surfaces goes to runoff; 
* 90% of flow from buildings goes to runoff, with small amounts going to other surfaces (mostly paved surfaces as buildings are often surrounded by paved areas);
* all flow from vegetated and bare soil areas goes into the sub-surface soil store;
* the row corresponding to water contains zeros (as it is currently not used).

====SUEWS_OHMCoefficients.txt==== <!--T:203-->
OHM, the Objective Hysteresis Model (Grimmond et al. 1991)<ref name="G91OHM"/> calculates the storage heat flux as a function of net all-wave radiation and surface characteristics.
*For each surface, OHM requires three model coefficients (a1, a2, a3). The three should be selected as a set.
*The '''SUEWS_OHMCoefficients.txt''' file provides these coefficients for each surface type.
*A variety of values has been derived for different materials and can be found in the literature (see: [http://urban-climate.net/umep/TypicalValues#OHM_Coefficients| Typical Values]). 
*Coefficients can be changed depending on:
:# surface wetness state (wet/dry) based on the calculated surface wetness state and soil moisture. 
:# season (summer/winter) based on a 5-day running mean air temperature.
*To use the same coefficients irrespective of wet/dry and summer/winter conditions, use the same code for all four OHM columns (OHMCode_SummerWet, OHMCode_SummerDry, OHMCode_WinterWet and OHMCode_WinterDry).

Note, '''AnOHM''' does not use the coefficients specified in SUEWS_OHMCoefficients.txt but instead requires three parameters to be specified for each surface type (including snow): heat capacity, thermal conductivity and bulk transfer coefficient. These are specified in [[#SUEWS_NonVeg.txt|SUEWS_NonVeg.txt]], [[#SUEWS_Veg.txt|SUEWS_Veg.txt]], [[#SUEWS_Water.txt|SUEWS_Water.txt]] and [[#SUEWS_Snow.txt|SUEWS_Snow.txt]].

====SUEWS_ESTMCoefficients.txt==== <!--T:208-->

'''Note ESTM is under development in v2017a and should not be used!'''

The Element Surface Temperature Method (ESTM) (Offerle et al., 2005) calculates the net storage heat flux from surface temperatures. In the method the three-dimensional urban volume is reduced to four 1-d elements (i.e. building roofs, walls, and internal mass and ground (road, vegetation, etc)). The storage heat flux is calculated from the heat conduction through the different elements. For the inside surfaces of the roof and walls, and both surfaces for the internal mass (ceilings/floors, internal walls), the surface temperature of the element is determined by setting the conductive heat transfer out of (in to) the surface equal to the radiative and convective heat losses (gains). Each element (roof, wall, internal element and ground) can have maximum five layers and each layer has three parameters tied to it: thickness (x), thermal conductivity (k), volumetric heat capacity (rhoCp).

If ESTM is used (QSchoice=4), the files [[#SUEWS_ESTMCoefficients.txt|SUEWS_ESTMCoefficients.txt]], [[#ESTMinput.nml|ESTMinput.nml]] and [[#SS_YYYY_ESTM_Ts_data_tt.txt|SS_YYYY_ESTM_Ts_data_tt.txt]] should be prepared. 

SUEWS_ESTMCoefficients.txt contains the parameters for the layers of each of the elements (roofs, wall, ground, internal mass).
*If less than five layers are used, the parameters for unused layers should be set to -999. 
*The ESTM coefficients with the prefix ''Surf_'' must be specified for each surface type (plus snow) but the ''Wall_''  and ''Internal_'' variables apply to the building surfaces only. 
*For each grid, one set of ESTM coefficients must be specified for each surface type; for paved and building surfaces it is possible to specify up to three and five sets of coefficients per grid (e.g. to represent different building materials) using the relevant columns in [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]]. For the model to use these columns in site select, the ESTMCode column in [[#SUEWS_NonVeg.txt|SUEWS_NonVeg.txt]] should be set to zero.

===Initial Conditions file=== <!--T:228-->
To start the model, information about the conditions at the start of the run is required. This information is provided in initial conditions file. One file can be specified for each grid (MultipleInitFiles=1 in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]], filename includes grid number) or, alternatively, a single file can be specified for all grids (MultipleInitFiles=0 in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]], no grid number in the filename). After that, a new InitialConditionsSSss_YYYY.nml file will be written for each grid for the following years. It is recommended that you look at these files (written to the input directory) to check the status of various surfaces at the end or the run. This may help you get more realistic starting values if you are uncertain what they should be. Note this file will be created for each year for multiyear runs for each grid. If the run finishes before the end of the year the InitialConditions file is still written and the file name is appended with '_EndofRun'.

The two most important pieces of information in the initial conditions file is the soil moisture and state of vegetation at the start of the run. This is the minimal information required; other information can be provided if known, otherwise SUEWS will make an estimate of initial conditions.

===Meteorological input file=== <!--T:231-->

<!--T:232-->
SUEWS is designed to run using commonly measured meteorological variables. 
*Required inputs must be continuous – i.e. '''gap fill''' any missing data. 
*The table below gives the required (R) and optional (O) additional input variables. 
*If an optional input variable is not available or will not be used by the model, enter ‘-999.0’ for this column.
*Since v2017a forcing files no longer need to end with two rows containing ‘-9’ in the first column.

<!--T:233-->
*One single meteorological file can be used for all grids ('''MultipleMetFiles=0''' in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]], no grid number in file name) if appropriate for the study area, or
*separate met files can be used for each grid if data are available ('''MultipleMetFiles=1''' in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]], filename includes grid number).

*The meteorological forcing file names should be appended with the temporal resolution in minutes (SS_YYYY_data_tt.txt, or SSss_YYYY_data_tt.txt for multiple grids).

<!--T:234-->
*Separate met forcing files should be provided for each year. 
*Files do not need to start/end at the start/end of the year, but they must contain a whole number of days. 
*The meteorological input file should match the information given in [[#SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt|SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt]]. 
*If a ''partial year'' is used that specific year must be given in SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt. 
*If ''multiple years'' are used, all years should be included in SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt. 
*If a ''whole year'' (e.g. 2011) is intended to be modelled using and hourly resolution dataset, the number of lines in the met data file should be 8760 and begin and end with:

 iy     id  it  imin

===SOLWEIG input files=== <!--T:249-->
If the SOLWEIG model option is used (SOLWEIGout=1), spatial data and a SOLWEIGInput.nml file need to be prepared. The Digital Surface Models (DSMs) as well as derivatives originating from DSMs, e.g. Sky View Factors (SVF) must have the same spatial resolution and extent. Since SOLWEIG is a 2D model it will considerably increase computation time and should be used with care.

<!--T:250-->
Description of choices in SOLWEIGinput_file.nml file. The file can be in any order.

==Output files== <!--T:272-->

===Error messages: problems.txt=== <!--T:273-->
If there are problems running the program serious error messages will be written to problems.txt. 
*Serious problems will usually cause the program to stop after writing the error message. If this is the case, the last line of problems.txt will contain a non-zero number (the error code).
*If the program runs successfully, problems.txt file ends with 
 Run completed.
 0

<!--T:274-->
SUEWS has a large number of error messages included to try to capture common errors to help the user determine what the problem is. If you encounter an error that does not provide an error message please capture the details so we can hopefully provide better error messages in future.

<!--T:275-->
See [[#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] section for help solving problems.
If the file paths are not correct the program will return an error when run (see [[#Preparing to run the model|Preparing to run the model]]).

===Error messages: warnings.txt===
*If the program encounters a more minor issue it will not stop but a warning may be written to warnings.txt. It is advisable to check the warnings to ensure there is not a more serious problem.
* The warnings.txt file can be large (over several GBs) given warning messages are written out during a large scale simulation, you can use <code> tail</code>/<code>head</code> to view the ending/starting part without opening the whole file on Unix-like systems (Linux/mac OS), which may slow down your system.
*To prevent warnings.txt from being written, set '''SuppressWarnings''' to 1 in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]].
*Warning messages are usually written with a grid number, timestamp and error count. If the problem occurs in the initial stages (i.e. before grid numbers and timestamps are assigned, these are printed as 00000).

===Summary of model parameters: SS_FileChoices.txt===

For each run, the model parameters specified in the input files are written out to the file SS_FileChoices.txt.

===Model output files=== <!--T:276-->

====SSss_YYYY_TT.txt ==== <!--T:277-->
SUEWS produces the main output file (SSss_YYYY_tt.txt) with time resolution (TT min) set by '''ResolutionFilesOut''' in [[#RunControl|RunControl]].

Before these main data files are written out, SUEWS provides a summary of the column names, units and variables included in the file Ss_YYYY_TT_OutputFormat.txt (one file per run).

The variables included in the main output file are determined according to '''WriteOutOption''' set in [[#RunControl.nml|RunControl.nml]].

====SSss_YYYY_nn_TT.nc (when ncMode=1 in RunControl) ==== <!--T:278-->
SUEWS can also produce the main output file in netCDF format by setting ncMode=1 (set in [[#RunControl|RunControl]]).

As the date and time information is incorporated in the netCDF output as separate dimension, the first five variables in the normal text output file (in .txt) are not included in the netCDF output but other variables are all kept. 

N.B., considering the file size limit by the classic netCDF format, the output frequency is determined automatically by the internal SUEWS program setting to avoid the oversize problem in the netCDF files.

====SSss_DailyState.txt==== <!--T:281-->
Contains information about the state of the surface and soil and vegetation parameters at a time resolution of one day. One file is written for each grid so it may contain multiple years.

==Troubleshooting== <!--T:289-->
====How to create a directory?====
: please search the web using this phrase if you do not know how to create a folder or directory
====How to unzip a file==== 
: please search the web using this phrase if you do not know how to unzip a file
====A text editor====
: is a program to edit plain text files. If you search on the web using the phrase ‘text editor’ you will find numerous programs. These include for example, NotePad, EditPad, Text Pad etc

====Command prompt==== 
: From Start select run –type cmd – this will open a window. Change directory to the location of where you stored your files. The following website may be helpful if you do not know what a command prompt is: http://dosprompt.info/

====Day of year [DOY]====
: January 1st is day 1, February 1st is day 32. If you search on the web using the phrase ‘day of year calendar’ you will find tables that allow rapid conversions. Remember that after February 28th DOY will be different between leap years and non-leap years.

====ESTM output====
First time steps of storage output could give NaN values during the initial converging phase.

===First things to Check if the program seems to have problems===
*Check the problems.txt file.
*Check file options – in RunControl.nml.
*Look in the output directory for the SS_FileChoices.txt. This allows you to check all options that were used in the run. You may want to compare it with the original version supplied with the model.
*Note there can not be missing time steps in the data. If you need help with this you may want to checkout [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP UMEP]

====A pop-up saying “file path not found"==== <!--T:291-->
This means the program cannot find the file paths defined in RunControl.nml file. Possible solutions:
*Check that you have created the folder that you specified in RunControl.nml. 
*Check does the output directory exist?
*Check that you have a single or double quotes around the FileInputPath, FileOutputPath and FileCode

====“%sat_vap_press.f temp=0.0000    pressure    dectime”====
Temperature is zero in the calculation of water vapour pressure parameterization. 
*You don’t need to worry if the temperature should be (is) 0°C. 
*If it should not be 0°C this suggests that there is a problem with the data.

====%T changed to fit limits====
*[TL =0.1]/ [TL =39.9] You may want to change the coefficients for surface resistance. If you have data from these temperatures, we would happily determine them.

====%Iteration loop stopped for too stable conditions.====
*[zL]/[USTAR] This warning indicates that the atmospheric stability gets above 2. In these conditions [http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Monin-obukhov_similarity_theory MO theory] is not necessarily valid. The iteration loop to calculate the [http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Obukhov_length Obukhov length] and [http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Friction_velocity friction velocity] is stopped so that stability does not get too high values. This is something you do not need to worry as it does not mean wrong input data.

====“Reference to undefined variable, array element or function result”====
*Parameter(s) missing from input files.

==Version History== <!--T:303-->
=== New in SUEWS Version 2018a ===

=== New in SUEWS Version 2017b (released 2 August 2017)===
[[:File:SUEWS_V2017b_Manual.pdf|PDF Manual for v2017b]]
#Surface-level diagnostics: T2 (air temperature at 2 m agl), Q2 (air specific humidity at 2 m agl) and U10 (wind speed at 10 m agl) added as default output.
#Output in netCDF format. Please note this feature is '''NOT''' enabled in the public release due to the dependency of netCDF library. Assistance in enabling this feature may be requested to the development team via [https://www.lists.reading.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/met-suews SUEWS mail list].
#Edits to the manual.
#New capabilities being developed, including two new options for calculating storage heat flux (AnOHM, ESTM) and modelling of carbon dioxide fluxes. These are currently under development and '''should not be used''' in v2017b.
#Known issues 
##BLUEWS parameters need to be checked
##Observed soil moisture can not be used as an input
##Wind direction is not currently downscaled so non -999 values will cause an error.

=== New in SUEWS Version 2017a (Feb 2017)===
#Changes to input file formats (including RunControl.nml and InitialConditions files) to facilitate setting up and running the model. Met forcing files no longer need two rows of -9 at the end to indicate the end of the file. 
#Changes to output file formats (now option to write out only a subset of variables, rather than all variables).
#SUEWS can now disaggregate forcing files to the model time-step and aggregate output at the model time-step to lower resolution. This removes the need for the python wrapper used with previous versions.
#InitialConditions format and requirements changed. A single file can now be provided for multiple grids. SUEWS will approximate most (but not all) of the required initial conditions if values are unknown. (However, if detailed information about the initial conditions is known, this can still be provided to and used by SUEWS.)
#Leaf area index calculations now use parameters provided for each vegetated surface (previously only the deciduous tree LAI development parameters were applied to all vegetated surfaces).
#For compatibility with GIS, '''the sign convention for longitude has been changed'''. Now negative values are to the west, positive values are to the east. Note this appears to have been incorrectly coded in previous versions (but may not necessarily have been problematic).
#Storage heat flux calculation adapted for shorter (sub-hourly) model time-step: hysteresis calculation now based on running means over the previous hour.
#Improved error handling, including separate files for serious errors (problems.txt) and less critical issues (warnings.txt).
#Edits to the manual.
#New capabilities being developed, including two new options for calculating storage heat flux (AnOHM, ESTM) and modelling of carbon dioxide fluxes. These are currently under development and '''should not be used''' in v2017a.

===New in SUEWS Version 2016a (released 21 June 2016)=== <!--T:304-->
[[:File:SUEWS_V2016a_Manual.pdf|PDF Manual for v2016a]]
#Major changes to the input file formats to facilitate the running of multiple grids and multiple years. Surface characteristics are provided in SiteSelect.txt and other input files are cross-referenced via codes or profile types.
#The surface types have been altered: 
#*Previously, grass surfaces were entered separately as irrigated grass and unirrigated grass surfaces, whilst the ‘unmanaged’ land cover fraction was assumed by the model to behave as unirrigated grass. There is now a single surface type for grass (total for irrigated plus unirrigated) and a new bare soil surface type. 
#*The proportion of irrigated vegetation must now be specified for grass, evergreen trees and deciduous trees individually.
#The entire model now runs at a time step specified by the user. Note that 5 min is strongly recommended. (Previously only the water balance calculations were done at 5 min with the energy balance calculations at 60 min).
#Surface conductance now depends on the soil moisture under the vegetated surfaces only (rather than the total soil moisture for the whole study area as previously).
#Albedo of evergreen trees and grass surfaces can now change with leaf area index as was previously possible for deciduous trees only.
#New suggestions in Troubleshooting section.
#Edits to the manual.
#CBL model included.
#SUEWS has been incorporated into [http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP UMEP]

===New in SUEWS Version 2014b (released 8 October 2014)=== <!--T:305-->
[[http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/micromet/documents/SUEWS_Manual.pdf| V2014 manual]]
These affect the run configuration if previously run with older versions of the model:
#New input of three additional columns in the Meteorological input file (diffusive and direct solar radiation, and wind direction) 
#   Change of input variables in InitialConditions.nml file. Note we now refer to CT as ET (ie. Evergreen trees rather than coniferous trees)
#   In GridConnectionsYYYY.txt, the site names should now be without the underscore (e.g “Sm” and not “Sm_”) 
Other issues:
#   Number of grid areas that can be modelled (for one grid, one year 120; for one grid two years 80)
#   Comment about Time interval of input data
#   Bug fix: Column headers corrected in 5 min file
#   Bug fix: Surface state 60 min file - corrected to give the last 5 min of the hour (rather than cumulating through the hour)
#   Bug fix: units in the Horizontal soil water transfer
#   ErrorHints: More have been added to the problems.txt file.
#   Manual: new section on running the model appropriately
#   Manual: notation table updated
#   Possibility to add snow accumulation and melt:  new paper 
Järvi L, Grimmond CSB, Taka M, Nordbo A, Setälä H, and Strachan IB 2014: Development of the Surface Urban Energy and Water balance Scheme (SUEWS) for cold climate cities, Geosci. Model Dev. 7, 1691-1711, doi:10.5194/gmd-7-1691-2014.

===New in SUEWS Version 2014a.1 (released 26 February 2014)=== <!--T:306-->
#   Please see the large number of changes made in the 2014a release.
#   This is a minor change to address installing the software.
#   Minor updates to the manual

===New in SUEWS Version 2014a (released 21 February 2014)===
#   Bug fix: External irrigation is calculated as combined from automatic and manual irrigation and during precipitation events the manual irrigation is reduced to 60% of the calculated values. In previous version of the model, the irrigation was in all cases taken 60% of the calculated value, but now this has been fixed.                                 
#   In previous versions of the model, irrigation was only allowed on the irrigated grass surface type. Now, irrigation is also allowed on evergreen and deciduous trees/shrubs surfaces. These are not however treated as separate surfaces, but the amount of irrigation is evenly distributed to the whole surface type in the modelled area. The amount of water is calculated using same equation as for grass surface (equation 5 in Järvi et al. 2011), and the fraction of irrigated trees/shrubs (relative to the area of tree/shrubs surface) is set in the gis file  (See Table 4.11: SSss_YYYY.gis) 
#   In the current version of the model, the user is able to adjust the leaf-on and leaf-off lengths in the FunctionalTypes. nml file. In addition, user can choose whether to use temperature dependent functions or combination of temperature and day length (advised to be used at high-latitudes)  
#   In the gis-file, there is a new variable Alt that is the area altitude above sea level. If not known exactly use an approximate value. 
#   Snow removal profile has been added to the HourlyProfileSSss_YYYY.txt. Not yet used!
#   Model time interval has been changed from minutes to seconds. Preferred interval is 3600 seconds (1 hour)
#   Manual correction: input variable Soil moisture said soil moisture deficit in the manual – word removed
#   Multiple compiled versions of SUEWS released. There are now users in Apple, Linux and Windows environments. So we will now release compiled versions for more operating systems (section 3).
#   There are some changes in the output file columns so please, check the respective table of each used output file.
#   Bug fix: with very small amount of vegetation in an area – impacted Phenology for LUMPS

===New in SUEWS Version 2013a===
#   Radiation selection bug fixed
#   Aerodynamic resistance – when very low  - no longer reverts to neutral (which caused a large jump) – but stays low
#   Irrigation day of week fixed
#   New error messages 
# min file – now includes a decimal time column – see Section 5.4 – Table 5.3
===New in SUEWS Version 2012b===
#   Error message generated if all the data are not available for the surface resistance calculations
#   Error message generated if wind data are below zero plane displacement height.
#   All error messages now written to ‘Problem.txt’ rather than embedded in an ErrorFile. Note some errors will be written and the program will continue others will stop the program.
#   Default variables removed (see below). Model will stop if any data are problematic. File should be checked to ensure that reasonable data are being used. If an error occurs when there should not be one let us know as it may mean we have made the limits too restrictive.

==Differences between SUEWS, LUMPS and FRAISE== <!--T:312-->

<!--T:313-->
The largest difference between LUMPS and SUEWS is that the latter simulates the urban water balance in detail while LUMPS takes a simpler approach for the sensible and latent heat fluxes and the water balance (“water bucket”). The calculation of evaporation/latent heat in SUEWS is more biophysically based. Due to its simplicity, LUMPS requires less parameters in order to run. SUEWS gives turbulent heat fluxes calculated with both models as an output.  '''The model can run LUMPS alone without running SUEWS (Table 4.1 – SuewsStatus).'''

===FRAISE Flux Ratio – Active Index Surface Exchange=== <!--T:314-->

<!--T:315-->
FRAISE provides an estimate of mean midday (±3 h around solar noon) energy partitioning from information on the surface characteristics and estimates of the mean midday incoming radiative energy and anthropogenic heat release. Please refer to Loridan and Grimmond (2012)<ref name="LG2012"> Loridan T and Grimmond CSB (2012) Characterization of energy flux partitioning in urban environments: links with surface seasonal properties.
