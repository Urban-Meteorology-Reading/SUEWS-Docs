RunControl.nml
--------------

The file **RunControl.nml** is a namelist that specifies the options for
the model run. It must be located in the same directory as the
executable file.

A sample file of **RunControl.nml** looks like

.. literalinclude:: RunControl.nml


.. note:: 
     - In *Linux* and *Mac*, please add an empty line after the end slash.
     - The file is not case-sensitive.
     - The parameters and variables can appear in any order.

Depending on how the storage heat flux is calculated (specified by
StorageHeatMethod in `RunControl.nml <#RunControl.nml>`__), different
input files are required:
