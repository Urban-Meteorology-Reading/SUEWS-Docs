Version 2012a
--------------------------

#. Improved error messages when an error is encountered. Error message
   will generally be written to the screen and to the file
   ‘problems.txt’
#. Format of all input files have changed.
#. New excel spreadsheet and R programme to help prepare required data
   files. (Not required)
#. Format of coef flux (OHM) input files have changed.

   -  This allows for clearer identification for users of the
      coefficients that are actually to be used
   -  This requires an additional file with coefficients. These do not
      need to be adjusted but new coefficients can be added. We would
      appreciate receiving additional coefficients so they can be
      included in future releases – Please email Sue.

#. Storage heat flux (OHM) coefficients can be changed by

   -  time of year (summer, winter)
   -  surface wetness state

#. New files are written: DailyState.txt

   -  Provides the status of variables that are updated on a daily or
      basis or a snapshot at the end of each day.

#. Surface Types

   -  Clarification of surface types has been made. See GIS and OHM
