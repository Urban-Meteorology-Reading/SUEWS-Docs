#. Surface-level diagnostics: T2 (air temperature at 2 m agl), Q2 (air
   specific humidity at 2 m agl) and U10 (wind speed at 10 m agl) added
   as default output.
#. Output in netCDF format. Please note this feature is **NOT** enabled
   in the public release due to the dependency of netCDF library.
   Assistance in enabling this feature may be requested to the
   development team via `SUEWS mail
   list <https://www.lists.reading.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/met-suews>`__.
#. Edits to the manual.
#. New capabilities being developed, including two new options for
   calculating storage heat flux (AnOHM, ESTM) and modelling of carbon
   dioxide fluxes. These are currently under development and **should
   not be used** in Version 2017b.
#. Known issues

   #. BLUEWS parameters need to be checked
   #. Observed soil moisture can not be used as an input
   #. Wind direction is not currently downscaled so non -999 values will cause an error.
