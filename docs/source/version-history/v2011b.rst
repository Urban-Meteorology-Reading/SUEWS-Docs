Version 2011b
-------------------------

#. Storage heat flux (ΔQs) and anthropogenic heat flux (QF) can be set
   to be 0 W |m^-2|
#. Calculation of hydraulic conductivity in soil has been improved and
   HydraulicConduct in SUEWSInput.nml is replaced with name
   SatHydraulicConduct
#. Following removed from HeaderInput.nml

   -  HydraulicConduct
   -  GrassFractionIrrigated
   -  PavedFractionIrrigated
   -  TreeFractionIrrigated

The lower three are now determined from the water use behaviour used in
SUEWS

#. Following added to HeaderInput.nml

   -  SatHydraulicConduct
   -  defaultQf
   -  defaultQs

#. If ΔQs and QF are not calculated in the model but are given as an
   input, the missing data is replaced with the default values.
#. Added to SAHP input file

   -  AHDIUPRF – diurnal profile used if EmissionsMethod = 1

Version 2012a this became obsolete OHM file (SSss_YYYY.ohm)
