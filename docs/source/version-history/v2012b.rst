--------------------------

#. Error message generated if all the data are not available for the
   surface resistance calculations
#. Error message generated if wind data are below zero plane
   displacement height.
#. All error messages now written to ‘Problem.txt’ rather than embedded
   in an ErrorFile. Note some errors will be written and the program
   will continue others will stop the program.
#. Default variables removed (see below). Model will stop if any data
   are problematic. File should be checked to ensure that reasonable
   data are being used. If an error occurs when there should not be one
   let us know as it may mean we have made the limits too restrictive.
