Version 2017a (Feb 2017)
-------------------------------------

#. Changes to input file formats (including RunControl.nml and
   InitialConditions files) to facilitate setting up and running the
   model. Met forcing files no longer need two rows of -9 at the end to
   indicate the end of the file.
#. Changes to output file formats (now option to write out only a subset
   of variables, rather than all variables).
#. SUEWS can now disaggregate forcing files to the model time-step and
   aggregate output at the model time-step to lower resolution. This
   removes the need for the python wrapper used with previous versions.
#. InitialConditions format and requirements changed. A single file can
   now be provided for multiple grids. SUEWS will approximate most (but
   not all) of the required initial conditions if values are unknown.
   (However, if detailed information about the initial conditions is
   known, this can still be provided to and used by SUEWS.)
#. Leaf area index calculations now use parameters provided for each
   vegetated surface (previously only the deciduous tree LAI development
   parameters were applied to all vegetated surfaces).
#. For compatibility with GIS, **the sign convention for longitude has
   been changed**. Now negative values are to the west, positive values
   are to the east. Note this appears to have been incorrectly coded in
   previous versions (but may not necessarily have been problematic).
#. Storage heat flux calculation adapted for shorter (sub-hourly) model
   time-step: hysteresis calculation now based on running means over the
   previous hour.
#. Improved error handling, including separate files for serious errors
   (problems.txt) and less critical issues (warnings.txt).
#. Edits to the manual.
#. New capabilities being developed, including two new options for
   calculating storage heat flux (AnOHM, ESTM) and modelling of carbon
   dioxide fluxes. These are currently under development and **should
   not be used** in Version 2017a.
