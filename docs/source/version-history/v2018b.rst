Version 2018b (released 17 December 2018)
----------------------------------------------------

- **Improvement**

  #. Improved calculation of OHM-related radiation terms:

     The temporal difference term ``dQ*/dt`` is now calculated using the time-step-weighted ``dQ*`` of previous time step instead of a series of ``Q*`` values from previous time steps, which improves the usage of memory and allows time-step-varying simulations (needed by WRF-SUEWS coupling).

- **Changes**

  None.

- **Fix**

  #. Fixed a bug in picking up external water use from meteorological forcing file.

- **Known issues**

  #. BLUEWS is disabled
  #. Observed soil moisture can not be used as an input
  #. Wind direction is not currently downscaled so non -999 values will cause an error.
