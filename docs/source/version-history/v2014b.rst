These affect the run configuration if previously run with older versions
of the model:

#. New input of three additional columns in the Meteorological input
   file (diffusive and direct solar radiation, and wind direction)
#. Change of input variables in InitialConditions.nml file. Note we now
   refer to CT as ET (ie. Evergreen trees rather than coniferous trees)
#. In GridConnectionsYYYY.txt, the site names should now be without the
   underscore (e.g ``Sm`` and not ``Sm_``)

Other issues:

#. Number of grid areas that can be modelled (for one grid, one year
   120; for one grid two years 80)
#. Comment about Time interval of input data
#. Bug fix: Column headers corrected in 5 min file
#. Bug fix: Surface state 60 min file - corrected to give the last 5 min
   of the hour (rather than cumulating through the hour)
#. Bug fix: units in the Horizontal soil water transfer
#. ErrorHints: More have been added to the problems.txt file.
#. Manual: new section on running the model appropriately
#. Manual: notation table updated
#. Possibility to add snow accumulation and melt: new paper
