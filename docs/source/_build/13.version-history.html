<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Changes to input file formats (including RunControl.nml and
InitialConditions files) to facilitate setting up and running the
model. Met forcing files no longer need two rows of -9 at the end to
indicate the end of the file.</li>
<li>Changes to output file formats (now option to write out only a subset
of variables, rather than all variables).</li>
<li>SUEWS can now disaggregate forcing files to the model time-step and
aggregate output at the model time-step to lower resolution. This
removes the need for the python wrapper used with previous versions.</li>
<li>InitialConditions format and requirements changed. A single file can
now be provided for multiple grids. SUEWS will approximate most (but
not all) of the required initial conditions if values are unknown.
(However, if detailed information about the initial conditions is
known, this can still be provided to and used by SUEWS.)</li>
<li>Leaf area index calculations now use parameters provided for each
vegetated surface (previously only the deciduous tree LAI development
parameters were applied to all vegetated surfaces).</li>
<li>For compatibility with GIS, <strong>the sign convention for longitude has
been changed</strong>. Now negative values are to the west, positive values
are to the east. Note this appears to have been incorrectly coded in
previous versions (but may not necessarily have been problematic).</li>
<li>Storage heat flux calculation adapted for shorter (sub-hourly) model
time-step: hysteresis calculation now based on running means over the
previous hour.</li>
<li>Improved error handling, including separate files for serious errors
(problems.txt) and less critical issues (warnings.txt).</li>
<li>Edits to the manual.</li>
<li>New capabilities being developed, including two new options for
calculating storage heat flux (AnOHM, ESTM) and modelling of carbon
dioxide fluxes. These are currently under development and <strong>should

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Major changes to the input file formats to facilitate the running of
multiple grids and multiple years. Surface characteristics are
provided in SiteSelect.txt and other input files are cross-referenced
via codes or profile types.</li>
<li>The surface types have been altered:<ul>
<li>Previously, grass surfaces were entered separately as irrigated
grass and unirrigated grass surfaces, whilst the ‘unmanaged’ land
cover fraction was assumed by the model to behave as unirrigated
grass. There is now a single surface type for grass (total for
irrigated plus unirrigated) and a new bare soil surface type.</li>
<li>The proportion of irrigated vegetation must now be specified for
grass, evergreen trees and deciduous trees individually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The entire model now runs at a time step specified by the user. Note
that 5 min is strongly recommended. (Previously only the water
balance calculations were done at 5 min with the energy balance
calculations at 60 min).</li>
<li>Surface conductance now depends on the soil moisture under the
vegetated surfaces only (rather than the total soil moisture for the
whole study area as previously).</li>
<li>Albedo of evergreen trees and grass surfaces can now change with leaf
area index as was previously possible for deciduous trees only.</li>
<li>New suggestions in Troubleshooting section.</li>
<li>Edits to the manual.</li>
<li>CBL model included.</li>

of the model:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>New input of three additional columns in the Meteorological input
file (diffusive and direct solar radiation, and wind direction)</li>
<li>Change of input variables in InitialConditions.nml file. Note we now
refer to CT as ET (ie. Evergreen trees rather than coniferous trees)</li>
<li>In GridConnectionsYYYY.txt, the site names should now be without the
underscore (e.g “Sm” and not “<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">Sm_</span></a>”)</li>

<li>ErrorHints: More have been added to the problems.txt file.</li>

<li>Bug fix: External irrigation is calculated as combined from automatic
and manual irrigation and during precipitation events the manual
irrigation is reduced to 60% of the calculated values. In previous
version of the model, the irrigation was in all cases taken 60% of
the calculated value, but now this has been fixed.</li>
<li>In previous versions of the model, irrigation was only allowed on the
irrigated grass surface type. Now, irrigation is also allowed on
evergreen and deciduous trees/shrubs surfaces. These are not however
treated as separate surfaces, but the amount of irrigation is evenly
distributed to the whole surface type in the modelled area. The
amount of water is calculated using same equation as for grass
surface (equation 5 in Järvi et al. 2011), and the fraction of
irrigated trees/shrubs (relative to the area of tree/shrubs surface)
is set in the gis file (See Table 4.11: SSss_YYYY.gis)</li>
<li>In the current version of the model, the user is able to adjust the
leaf-on and leaf-off lengths in the FunctionalTypes. nml file. In
addition, user can choose whether to use temperature dependent
functions or combination of temperature and day length (advised to be
used at high-latitudes)</li>
<li>In the gis-file, there is a new variable Alt that is the area
altitude above sea level. If not known exactly use an approximate
value.</li>
<li>Snow removal profile has been added to the
HourlyProfileSSss_YYYY.txt. Not yet used!</li>
<li>Model time interval has been changed from minutes to seconds.
Preferred interval is 3600 seconds (1 hour)</li>
<li>Manual correction: input variable Soil moisture said soil moisture
deficit in the manual – word removed</li>
<li>Multiple compiled versions of SUEWS released. There are now users in
Apple, Linux and Windows environments. So we will now release
compiled versions for more operating systems (section 3).</li>
<li>There are some changes in the output file columns so please, check
the respective table of each used output file.</li>
