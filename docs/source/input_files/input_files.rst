Input files
===========


SUEWS allows you to input a large number of parameters to describe the
characteristics of your site. You should not assume that the example
values provided in files or in the tables below are appropriate. Values
marked with 'MD' are examples of recommended values (see the suggested
references to help decide how appropriate these are for your site/model
domain); values marked with 'MU' need to be set (i.e. changed from the
example) for your site/model domain.
