SUEWS_Soil.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SUEWS_Soil.txt specifies the characteristics of the sub-surface soil
below each of the non-water surface types (Paved, Bldgs, EveTr, DecTr,
Grass, BSoil). The model does not have a soil store below the water
surfaces. Note that these sub-surface soil stores are different to the
bare soil/unmamnaged surface cover type. Each of the non-water surface
types need to link to soil characteristics specified here. If the soil
characteristics are assumed to be the same for all surface types, use a
single code value to link the characteristics here with the SoilTypeCode
columns in `SUEWS_NonVeg.txt` and `SUEWS_Veg.txt`.

Soil moisture can either be provided using observational data in the met
forcing file (`SMDMethod` = 1 or 2 in
`RunControl.nml`) and providing some metadata information here (OBS columns),
or modelled by SUEWS (`SMDMethod` = 0 in `RunControl.nml`).

.. caution::
  The option to use observational data is not operational in the current release!
