SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeat.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeatFlux.txt provides the parameters needed to model
the anthropogenic heat flux using either the method of JÃ¤rvi et al.
(2011) based on heating and cooling degree days (`EmissionsMethod` = 2
in `RunControl.nml`) or the method of Loridan et
al. (2011) based on air temperature (`EmissionsMethod` = 1 in
`RunControl.nml`). The sub-daily variation in
anthropogenic heat flux is modelled according to the daily cycles
specified in SUEWS_Profiles.txt. 

Alternatively, if available, the anthropogenic heat flux can be provided in the met forcing file (and set `EmissionsMethod` = 0 in `RunControl.nml`) by filling the `qf` column with valid values.
