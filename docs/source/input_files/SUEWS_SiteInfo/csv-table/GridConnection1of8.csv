"`SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt`","`MD` `MU`","The next 8 pairs of columns specify the water flow between grids. The first column of each pair specifies the grid that the water flows to (from the current grid, column 1); the second column of each pair specifies the fraction of water that flow to that grid. The fraction (i.e. amount) of water transferred may be estimated based on elevation, the length of connecting surface between grids, presence of walls, etc. Water cannot flow from the current grid to the same grid, so the grid number here must be different to the grid number in column 1. Water can flow to a maximum of 8 other grids. If there is no water flow between grids, or a single grid is run, set to 0. See section on Grid Connections"
