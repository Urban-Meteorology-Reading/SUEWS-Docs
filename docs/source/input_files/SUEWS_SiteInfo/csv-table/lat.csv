"`SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt`","`MU`","Use coordinate system WGS84. Positive values are northern hemisphere (negative southern hemisphere). Used in radiation calculations. Note, if the total modelled area is small the latitude and longitude could be the same for each grid but small differences in radiation will not be determined. If you are defining the latitude and longitude differently between grids make certain that you provide enough decimal places."
