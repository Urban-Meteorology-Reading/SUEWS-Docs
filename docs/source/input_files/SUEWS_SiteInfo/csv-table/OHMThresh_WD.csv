"`SUEWS_NonVeg.txt`","`MD`","Soil moisture threshold determining whether wet/dry OHM coefficients are applied [-] If soil moisture (as a proportion of maximum soil moisture capacity) exceeds this threshold for bare soil and vegetated surfaces, OHM coefficients for wet conditions are applied; otherwise coefficients for dry coefficients are applied. Note that OHM coefficients for wet conditions are applied if the surface is wet. Not actually used for building and paved surfaces (as impervious). "
