"`SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt`","`L`","Code for surface conductance parameters Provides the link to column 1 of `SUEWS_Conductance.txt`, which contains the parameters for the Jarvis (1976) [Ja76]_ parameterisation of surface conductance. Value of integer is arbitrary but must match code specified in column 1 of `SUEWS_Conductance.txt`. e.g. 33 means use the characteristics specified in the row of input file `SUEWS_Conductance.txt` which has 33 in column 1 (Code).
