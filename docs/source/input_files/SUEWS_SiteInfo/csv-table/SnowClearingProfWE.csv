"`SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt`","`L`","Code for snow clearing profile (weekends) Provides the link to column 1 of `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`. Value of integer is arbitrary but must match code specified in column 1 of `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`. e.g. 1 means use the characteristics specified in the row of input file SUEWS_Profiles.txt which has 1 in column 1 (Code). Providing the same code for `SnowClearingProfWD` and `SnowClearingProfWE` would link to the same row in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`, i.e. the same profile would be used for weekdays and weekends. "
