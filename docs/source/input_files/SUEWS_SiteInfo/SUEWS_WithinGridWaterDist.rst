SUEWS_WithinGridWaterDist.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SUEWS_WithinGridWaterDist.txt specifies the movement of water between
surfaces within a grid/area. It allows impervious connectivity to be
taken into account.

Each row corresponds to a surface type (linked by the Code in column 1
to the `SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt` columns:
WithinGridPavedCode, WithinGridBldgsCode, …, WithinGridWaterCode). Each
column contains the fraction of water flowing from the surface type to
each of the other surface types or to runoff or the sub-surface soil
store.

.. note::

  -  The sum of each row (excluding the Code) must equal 1.
  -  Water **CANNOT** flow from one surface to that same surface, so the
     diagonal elements should be zero.
  -  The row corresponding to the water surface should be zero, as there
     is currently no flow permitted from the water surface to other
     surfaces by the model.
  -  Currently water **CANNOT** go to both runoff and soil store (i.e. it
     must go to one or the other – `runoff` for impervious surfaces;
     `soilstore` for pervious surfaces).

In the table below, for example,

-  All flow from paved surfaces goes to runoff;
-  90% of flow from buildings goes to runoff, with small amounts going
   to other surfaces (mostly paved surfaces as buildings are often
   surrounded by paved areas);
-  All flow from vegetated and bare soil areas goes into the sub-surface
   soil store;
-  The row corresponding to water contains zeros (as it is currently not
   used).
