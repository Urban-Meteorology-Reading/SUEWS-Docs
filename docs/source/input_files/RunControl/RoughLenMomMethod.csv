1,"Values specified in SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt are used. Note that UMEP provides tools to calculate these]. See Kent et al. (2017a) for recommendations on methods. Kent et al. (2017b) have developed a method to include vegetation which is also avaialble within UMEP.

2,"z0m and zd are calculated using 'rule of thumb' (Grimmond and Oke 1999 [30] ) using mean building and tree height specified in SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt .
z0m and zd are adjusted with time to account for seasonal variation in porosity of deciduous trees."
3,"z0m and zd are calculated based on the MacDonald et al. (1998) [31] method using mean building and tree heights, plan area fraction and frontal areal index specified in SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt .
z0m and zd are adjusted with time to account for seasonal variation in porosity of deciduous trees."
