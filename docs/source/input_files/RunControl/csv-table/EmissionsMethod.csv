0,"Uses values provided in the meteorological forcing file (SSss_YYYY_data_tt.txt).
If you do not want to include QF to the calculation of surface energy balance, you should set values in the meteorological forcing file to zero to prevent calculation of QF.
UMEP provides two methods to calculate QF
LQF which is simpler
GQF which is more complete but requires more data inputs"
1,"|NotRecmd|
Calculated according to Loridan et al. (2011) [L2011]_ using coefficients specified in SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeat.txt.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
2,"|Recmd|
Calculated according to JÃ¤rvi et al. (2011) [J11]_ using coefficients specified in SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeat.txt and diurnal patterns specified in SUEWS_Profiles.txt.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
3,"Updated Loridan et al. (2011) [L2011]_ method using daily (not instantaneous) air temperature (HDD(id-1,3)) using coefficients specified in SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeat.txt.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
