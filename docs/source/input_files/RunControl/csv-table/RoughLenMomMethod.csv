      Note that UMEP provides tools to calculate these. See Kent et al. (2017a) [Kent2017a]_ for recommendations on methods.
      Kent et al. (2017b) [Kent2017b]_ have developed a method to include vegetation which is also avaialble within UMEP."
2,"z0m and zd are calculated using 'rule of thumb' (Grimmond and Oke 1999 [GO99]_) using mean building and tree height specified in `SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt`.
z0m and zd are adjusted with time to account for seasonal variation in porosity of deciduous trees."
3,"z0m and zd are calculated based on the MacDonald et al. (1998) [Mc98]_ method using mean building and tree heights, plan area fraction and frontal areal index specified in `SUEWS_SiteSelect.txt`.
z0m and zd are adjusted with time to account for seasonal variation in porosity of deciduous trees."
