.. option:: LeavesOutInitially

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Flag for initial leave status [1 or 0]

	:Configuration:
		If the model run starts in winter when trees are bare, set `LeavesOutInitially` = 0 and the vegetation parameters will be set accordingly based on the values set in SUEWS_SiteInfo.xlsm. If the model run starts in summer when leaves are fully out, set `LeavesOutInitially` = 1 and the vegetation parameters will be set accordingly based on the values set in SUEWS_SiteInfo.xlsm. Not LeavesOutInitially can only be set to 0, 1 or -999 (fractional values cannot be used to indicate partial leaf-out). The value of `LeavesOutInitially` overrides any values provided for the individual vegetation parameters. To prevent `LeavesOutInitially` from setting the initial conditions, either omit it from the namelist or set to -999. If values are provided individually, they should be consistent the information provided in SUEWS_Veg.txt and the time of year. If values are provided individually, values for all required surfaces must be provided (i.e. specifying only `albGrass0` but not `albDecTr0` nor `albEveTr0` is not permitted).


.. option:: GDD_1_0

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		GDD related initial value
	:Configuration:
		Cannot be negative. If leaves are already full, then this should be the same as `GDDFull` in `SUEWS_Veg.txt`. If winter, set to 0. It is important that the vegetation characteristics are set correctly (i.e. for the start of the run in summer/winter).


.. option:: GDD_2_0

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		GDD related initial value
	:Configuration:
		Cannot be positive If the leaves are full but in early/mid summer then set to 0. If late summer or autumn , this should be a negative value. If leaves are off , then use the values of `SDDFull` in `SUEWS_Veg.txt` to guide your minimum value. It is important that the vegetation characteristics are set correctly (i.e. for the start of the run in summer/winter).


.. option:: LAIinitialEveTr

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Initial LAI for evergreen trees `EveTr`.
	:Configuration:
		The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`


.. option:: LAIinitialDecTr

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Initial LAI for deciduous trees `DecTr`.
	:Configuration:
		The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`


.. option:: LAIinitialGrass

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Initial LAI for irrigated grass `Grass`.
	:Configuration:
		The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`


.. option:: albEveTr0

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Albedo of evergreen surface `EveTr` on day 0 of run
	:Configuration:
		The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`


.. option:: albDecTr0

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Albedo of deciduous surface `DecTr` on day 0 of run
	:Configuration:
		The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`


.. option:: albGrass0

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Albedo of grass surface `Grass` on day 0 of run
	:Configuration:
		The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`


.. option:: decidCap0

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Storage capacity of deciduous surface `DecTr` on day 0 of run.
	:Configuration:
		The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`


.. option:: porosity0

	:Requirement:
		Optional
	:Description:
		Porosity of deciduous vegetation on day 0 of run.
	:Configuration:
		This varies between 0.2 (leaf-on) and 0.6 (leaf-off). The recommended values can be found from `SUEWS_Veg.txt`
