.. _Footprint:

Footprint modelling
===================

Introduction
------------

Each meteorological instrument has a ‘\ *source area*\ ’ (sometimes
referred to as *footprint*), the area that influences the measurement.
The shape and location of that area is a function of the meteorological
variable the sensor measures and the method of operation of the sensor.

For turbulent heat fluxes measured with a sonic anemometer, extensive
effort has been directed to try and model the ‘probable source area
location’ (Leclerc and Foken 2014). Numerous models exist, but the
Kormann and Meixner (2001) and Kljun et al. (2015) models are used in
UMEP. Both models require input of information about the wind direction,
stability, turbulence characteristics (friction velocity, variance of
the lateral or crosswind wind velocity) and roughness parameters. Kljun
et al. (2015) requires the boundary layer height.

Initial Practical steps
-----------------------

-  If **QGIS** is not on your computer you will `need to install
   it <Getting_Started>`
-  Then install the `UMEP <Getting_Started>`.plugin 

-  Start the QGIS software
-  If not visible on the desktop use the **Start** button to find the
   software (i.e. Find QGIS under your applications)
-  Select **QGIS 2.18.x Desktop** (or the latest version installed). Do not use QGIS3 at this point.

When you open it on the top toolbar you will see **UMEP**.

-  If UMEP is not on your machine, add the UMEP plugin by go to *Plugins>Manage and Install Plugins* in QGIS
   and search for UMEP. Click **Install plugin**. Here you can also see if there is newer versions of your added plugins.

-  Preferably, read through the section in the `online manual <SourceArea(Point)>`__
   BEFORE using the model, so you are familiar with it’s operation and terminology used.

Data for Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the appropriate data:

- Reading: `download <https://github.com/Urban-Meteorology-Reading/Urban-Meteorology-Reading.github.io/tree/master/other%20files/DataReading.zip>`__

- London: `download <https://github.com/Urban-Meteorology-Reading/Urban-Meteorology-Reading.github.io/tree/master/other%20files/DataSmallAreaLondon.zip>`__


Prior to Starting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Download the **Data needed for the Tutorial**. You can use either Reading of the London dataset. 

#. Load the Raster data (`DEM, DSM,
   CDSM <Abbreviations>`) 
   *files – DOES A CDSM EXIST? Yes for London, No for Reading*

   -  Go to: *Layer > Add layer > Add Raster Layer*. Locate downloaded files add add them to your QGIS project.

-  Have a look at the **layers** (see lower left) - if you untick the
   box layer names from the top you can see the different layers.

Source Area Modelling
---------------------

To access the Source area model or Footprint model, go to *UMEP -> Pre-processor > Urban Morphology > Source Area Model (Point)*.

#. Click on Select Point on Canvas – then select a point (e.g. where an Eddy Covariance (EC) tower site is located)

#. Select the appropriate surface elevation data file names

#. Choose the model you wish to run (Kormann and Meixner 2001 or Kljun et al. 2015)

#. Some initial parameters values are given - think about what would be appropriate values for your site and period   of interest. The manual has   more information (e.g. definitions) of the input variables.

	- The values are dependent on the meteorological conditions and the surface surrounding the site. The former   obviously vary on an hour to hour basis (or shorter time periods), whereas the others are dependent on the wind direction and the fetch characteristics.
	
#. Add a prefix and an output folder.

#. Tick “add the integrated source area to your project”. This will provide visual information of the location of the source area (footprint)

#. Click **Run**. If you get an error/warning message (model is unable to execute your request, as the maximum fetch exceeds the extent of your grid for your point of interest. measure the distance to the limit of your raster maps

	- To allow the model to work for the dataset with your point of interest you need to adjust the maximum fetch distance.
	- Locate the Measure tool.
	- Measure the distance to the point of interest to the boundary of the DSM data set.
	- Adjust the maximum fetch.
	- Click Run and wait for the calculations to finish.

The **output is a source area** grid showing the cumulative percentage of source area influencing the flux at the point of interest.

- To display the legend correctly in the layer window: Double-click on the source area grid and then click OK without doing any changes. The source area display is showing up to 98% of the cumulative area.

- Other output: A text file giving both the input setting variables and the output morphometric parameters calculated based on the source area generated. More information is provided in the manual, row titled: “Output”

It is possible to input a text file to generate a source area based on morphometric parameters (e.g. an hourly dataset). However, for now you can moodify the input variables set in the interface. Format of file is given in the manual.


Iterative process
-----------------

To work with a site with no value known *a priori*.

#. Use the `MorphometricCalculator(Point)` tool in the UMEP plugin to select a
   point to get the initial parameter values:

   #. UMEP-> Pre-Processor -> Urban Morphology -> Image Morphometric
      Calculator (Point)
   #. Open the output files

#. **Anisotropic** file – has the values in, e.g., 5 degree **sectors**
   – i.e. what you selected. This is appropriate if the area is very
   inhomogeneous.
#. **Isotropic** file - has the **average value** for the area
#. Use these values to populate the source area model window.


Roughness parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the UMEP plugin the roughness length and zero plane displacement
length can be calculated with a morphometric method based on the Rule of
Thumb (Grimmond and Oke 1999) as the default. There are other methods
available: Bottema (1995), Kanda et al. (2013), Macdonald et al. (1998),
Millward-Hopkins et al. (2011) and Raupach (1994, 1995). Many of these
have been developed for urban roughness elements. The Raupach method was
originally intended for forested areas but has also been found to
perform well for urban areas.

With wind profile and eddy covariance anemometric data and the source
area model, appropriate parameters can be determined and morphometric
methods assessed (e.g. Kent et al. 2017).
