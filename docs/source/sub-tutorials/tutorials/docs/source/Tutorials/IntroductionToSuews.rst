Urban Energy Balance - SUEWS Introduction
=========================================

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial you will use a land-surface model,
`SUEWS <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__ to simulate energy
exchanges in a city (London is the test case).

SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme) allows the energy
and water balance exchanges for urban areas to be modelled (Järvi et al.
2011, 2014, Ward et al. 2016a). The model is applicable at the
neighbourhood scale (e.g. 10\ :sup:`2` to 10\ :sup:`4` m). The fluxes
calculated are applicable to height of about 2-3 times the mean height
of the roughness elements; i.e. above the `roughness sublayer
(RSL) <http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Roughness_sublayer>`__. The use
of SUEWS within Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (UMEP)
provides an introduction to the model and the processes simulated, the
parameters used and the impact on the resulting fluxes.

Tools such as this, once appropriately assessed for an area, can be used
for a broad range of applications. For example, for climate services
(e.g. http://www.wmo.int/gfcs/). Running a model can allow analyses,
assessments, and long-term projections and scenarios. Most applications
require not only meteorological data but also information about the
activities that occur in the area of interest (e.g. agriculture,
population, road and infrastructure, and socio-economic variables).

Model output may be needed in many formats depending on a users’ needs.
Thus, the format must be useful, while ensuring the science included
within the model is appropriate. The figure below provides an overview of
`UMEP <index_page>`, a city based climate
service tool (CBCST). Within UMEP there are a number of models which can
predict and diagnose a range of meteorological processes. In this
activity we are concerned with SUEWS, initially the central components
of the model. See `manual <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__ or
published papers for more detailed information of the model.

   Overview of the climate service tool UMEP (from Lindberg et al. 2018)

SUEWS can be run in a number of different ways:

#. Within UMEP via the Simple selection. This is useful for becoming
   familiar with the model (Part 1)
#. Within UMEP via the Advanced selection. This can be used to exploit
   the full capabilities of the model (Part 2)
#. SUEWS standalone (see
   `manual <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__)
#. Within other larger scale models (e.g. WRF).

SUEWS Simple Objectives
-----------------------

This tutorial introduces SUEWS and demonstartes how to run the model within `UMEP (Urban
Multi-scale Environmental Predictor) <index_page>`. `Help with
Abbreviations <Abbreviations>`

Steps
~~~~~

#. An introduction to the model and how it is designed.
#. Different kinds of input data that are needed to run the model
#. How to run the model
#. How to examine the model output

Initial Steps
-------------

UMEP is a python plugin used in conjunction with
`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`__. To install the software and the UMEP
plugin see the `getting started <Getting_Started>` section in the UMEP manual.

As UMEP is under development, some documentation may be missing and/or
there may be instability. Please report any issues or suggestions to our
`repository <https://bitbucket.org/fredrik_ucg/umep/>`__.

SUEWS Model Inputs
------------------

Details of the model inputs and outputs are provided in the `SUEWS
manual <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__. As this tutorial is
concerned with a **simple application** only the most critical
parameters are shown. Other versions allow many other parameters to be
modified to more appropriate values if applicable. The table below
provides an overview of the parameters that can be modified in the
Simple application of SUEWS.

How to Run SuewsSimple from the UMEP-plugin
-------------------------------------------

#. Open SuewsSimple from *UMEP -> Processor -> Urban Energy Balance ->
   Urban Energy Balance, SUEWS (Simple)*. The GUI that opens looks quite
   extensive but it is actually not that complicated to start a basic
   model run (figure below). Some additional information about the plugin is
   found in the left window. As you can read, a **test dataset** from
   observations for London, UK (`Kotthaus and Grimmond
   2014 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095513000503>`__,
   `Ward et al.
   2016a <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095516300256>`__)
   is included in within the plugin.

    :alt:  none
    :width: 1107px

    The interface for SUEWS, simple version (click on image to make it larger).
   
#. To make use of this dataset click on **Add settings from test
   dataset** (see near bottom of the box). The land cover fractions and
   all other settings originate from Kotthaus and Grimmond (2014). They
   used a source area model to obtain the different input parameters
   (their `Fig. 7 in Kotthaus and Grimmond,
   2014 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095513000497>`__).
#. Before you start the model, change the location of the output data to
   any location of your choice. Also, make notes on the settings such as
   *Year* etc.
#. Do a model run and explore the results by clicking **Run**. A command
   window appears, when SUEWS performs the calculations using the
   settings from the interface. Once the calculations are done, some of
   the results are shown in two summary plots.

Model results
-------------

The graphs in the upper figure are the monthly mean energy (left) and water
balance (right). The lower graphs show the radiation fluxes,
energy fluxes, and water related outputs throughout the year. This plot
includes a lot of data and it might be difficult to examine it in
detail.

To zoom into the plot: use the tools in the top left corner, to zoom to
a period of interest. For example, the Zoom in to about the last ten
days in March (figure below). This was a period with clear relatively
weather.

Saving a Figure
---------------

Use the disk tool in the upper left corner.

Output data Files
-----------------

In the output folder (you selected earlier) you will find (at least)
three files:

#. **Kc98_2012_60.txt** – provides the 60 min model results for site
   “KC1” for the year 2012
#. **Kc_FilesChoices.txt** – this indicates all options used in the
   model run see the SUEWS Manual for interpretation of content (this is
   for when you are doing large number of runs so you know exactly what
   options were used in each run)
#. **Kc98_DailyState.txt** – this provides the daily mean state (see
   SUEWS manual for detailed explanation). This allows you to see, for
   example, the daily state of the LAI (leaf area index).
#. **Kc_OutputFormat.txt** – provides detailed information about the
   output files such as extended descriptions for each column including
   units.

If you open these files in a text editor. To understand the header
variables read the `SUEWS
manual <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__.

Sensitivity to land surface fractions
-------------------------------------

   Land cover fractions (click on image to make it larger). 

The previous results are for a densely build-up area in
London, UK. In order to test the sensitivity of SUEWS to some surface
properties you can think about changing some of the surface properties
in the SUEWS Simple. For example, change the land cover fraction by:

#. Change the land cover fractions as seen in the figure. Feel free to
   select other values as long as all the fractions *add up to 1.0*.
#. Save the output to a different folder by selecting *output folder*.
#. Click *Run*.

Morphometric Methods to determine Roughness parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more and overview and details see `Grimmond and Oke
(1999) <http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0450%281999%29038%3C1262%3AAPOUAD%3E2.0.CO%3B2>`__
and `Kent et al.
(2017a) <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10546-017-0248-z>`__.
This uses the height and spacing of roughness elements (e.g. buildings,
trees) to model the roughness parameters. For more details see `Kent et
al.
(2017a) <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10546-017-0248-z>`__,
`Kent et al.
(2017b) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610516307346?via%3Dihub>`__
and [Kent et al. (2017c)]. UMEP has tools for doing this: *Pre-processor

The `Kormann and Meixner

model is used to determine the probable area that a turbulent flux
measurement was impacted by. This is a function of wind direction,
stability, turbulence characteristics (friction velocity, variance of
the lateral wind velocity) and roughness parameters.
