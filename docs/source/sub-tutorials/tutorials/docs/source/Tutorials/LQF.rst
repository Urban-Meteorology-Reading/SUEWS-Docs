Anthropogenic heat - LQF
========================

This tutorial demonstrates how the LQF software is used to simulate
anthropogenic heat fluxes for London, UK, in the year 2015, using a
mixture of administrative and meteorological data.

Initial Practical steps
-----------------------

UMEP is a python plugin used in conjunction with
`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`__. To install the software and the UMEP
plugin see the `getting
started <Getting_Started>`
section in the UMEP manual.

For this tutorial you will need certain python libraries: **Pandas** and
**NetCDF**. Instructions how to install python libraries are located
`here <Python_Libraries>`.

As UMEP is under constant development, some documentation may be missing
and/or there may be instability. Please report any issues or suggestions
to our `repository <https://bitbucket.org/fredrik_ucg/umep/>`__.

Data for this exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to proceed, you will need the zip file named LQF\_Inputs\_1.zip
and a copy of the LQF database. These are available at the following
locations:

#. `LQF database <https://urban-meteorology-reading.github.io/other%20files/LQF_Database.zip>`__ - v1.2 was used to
   produce this tutorial
#. `LQF input
   files <https://urban-meteorology-reading.github.io/other%20files/LQF_Inputs_1.zip>`__
   from the UMEP tutorials data repository.

You may also wish to consult the `LQF user guide <LQF_Manual>`__

The LQF\_Inputs\_1.zip file contains several datasets to cover all of
the tutorials on this page:

-  LondonBuildingProfiles.csv: Seasonal diurnal profiles of building
   energy consumption (1 hour resolution; 7 days; 6 times of year)
-  weeklyTraffic.csv: Diurnal profile of road transport volume (1 hour
   resolution; 7 days)
-  DataSources.nml: LQF data sources
-  Parameters.nml: LQF Calculation parameters
-  griddedResidentialPopulation.\*: Spatial data containing residential
   population counts
-  dailyTemperature\_2015.csv: Daily mean air temperature in London

LQF Tutorial 1: Simple QF modelling
-----------------------------------

Preparing data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manage input data files
+++++++++++++++++++++++

-  Extract the contents of LQF\_Inputs\_1.zip into a folder on your
   local machine and note the path to each file (e.g.
   C:\\LQFData\\LondonBuildingProfiles.csv)
-  Save the LQF database to the same folder as the other data.

Gather information about output areas shapefile
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The input data comes with one shapefile
(griddedResidentialPopulation.shp) (a collection of files with the same
name, one of which ends in .shp). For convenience, the same shapefile is
used to define both the model output areas and the residential
population density:

-  **Model output areas**: The spatial units where each value of QF is
   calculated.
-  **Residential population**: The number of people within each spatial
   unit.

LQF needs several pieces of information about the input shapefiles:

#. **File path:** (e.g. c:\\LQFData\\PopulationData.shp) - the location
   of the **.shp** file on your computer
#. **EPSG code:** A number that defines the coordinate reference system
   (CRS) of the shapefile
#. **Feature ID field:** An attribute within the output areas file that
   contains a unique identifier for each output area.
#. **Start date** (population data only): The earliest modelled date for
   which this dataset should be used

Points (2) and (3) need information from the shapefile itself, as they
change depending on the file used. `Click
here <LQF_Manual#Appendix_B:_Gathering_information_about_shapefiles_for_QF_modelling>`__
for a guide to finding the EPSG code and feature ID field using QGIS.

Verify the population attribute name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The shapefile used for population data in LQF must always contain an
attribute “Pop” that holds the total number of people in that spatial
unit. Check this is the case (a similar process to finding the Feature
ID field name). The population data was gridded using an algorithm, so
the number of people in each area may not be a whole number.

Set up the DataSources.nml file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add shapefile information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The data sources file needs to be updated so that it can find the
various data files, and understands what to do with them. A full
description of the Data sources file contents is available
`here <LQF_Manual#Data_sources_file>`__, but this section shows how to
build up the entries.

#. Open DataSources.nml using a text editor (we recommend Notepad++) and
   update the entries according to the information gathered above.
#. There are several sections in the data sources file. Each is bounded
   by **&section\_name** and ends with **“/”** and deals with a
   different part of the input data
#. The “**shapefile**” entry is the path to the file
#. The **epsgCode** and **featureIds** entries are as described earlier
#. The **start date** for the residential population data is January 1
   2011, which needs to be entered as YYYY-mm-dd (2011-01-01).
#. The population shapefile is used for both the output areas and the
   residential population, so the same filename, EPSG code and featureID
   are used to describe both of them

The first two sections of the DataSources.nml file should now look like
this:
::

    &outputAreas
       shapefile = 'C:/Some/Path/To/Files/griddedResidentialPopulation.shp'
       epsgCode = 32631
       featureIds = 'ID' 
    /
    &residentialPop
       shapefiles = 'C:/Some/Path/To/Files/griddedResidentialPopulation.shp'
       startDates = '2011-01-01'
       epsgCodes = 32631
       featureIds = 'ID'


Add the LQF database and mean daily temperature files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

LQF needs to know the location of its database of national parameters.
::

   &database
      path = 'C:/Some/Path/To/Files/LQFDatabase_V1-2.sqlite'
   /

-  The daily temperature file (dailyTemperature\_2015.csv in the zip
   file) must be formatted appropriately for LQF. `See the
   manual <LQF_Manual#Daily_temperature>`__ for a detailed description
   of the file format


::

  &temporal
      ! Air temperature each day for a year
      dailyTemperature = 'C:\Some\Path\To\Files \dailyTemperature_2015.csv'
  /

The data sources file should now look similar to the example shown in
`the LQF manual <LQF_Manual#Data_sources_file>`__. In this tutorial, the
default diurnal profiles of traffic and building energy use stored in
the database will be used, but `they can be
overridden <#Tutorial_2a:_Custom_diurnal_profiles>`__ by adding options
to the data sources file.

Run LQF
~~~~~~~

Under UMEP > Processor > Urban Energy Balance, choose LQf (LUCY)

.. figure:: /images/LQF_Tutorial_RunUMEP.png
   :alt: LQF_Tutorial_RunUMEP.png
   :width: 300px

    ```to do```


This loads the model interface dialog box:

.. figure:: /images/LQF_Tutorial_RunLQF.png

    ```to do```
    
Choose configuration files and output folder
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Working from the top of the dialog box to the bottom...

#. Click the … buttons in the “Configuration and raw input data” panel
   to browse to the parameters.nml and DataSources.nml files. A pop-up
   error message will warn of any problems inside the files.
#. **Output path:** A folder in which the model outputs will be stored.
   It is **strongly recommended** that a new folder is used each time.
#. **Extra spatial disaggregation** step is not used here
#. Click **Prepare input data using Data Sources** button. This may be a
   time-consuming step: It matches each output area with a population
   and national parameters from the database, which contains different
   values for each country. If the output areas and population areas are
   not identical, it also splits the population across output areas
   based on their overlapping fractions.
#. Once this step is complete, the **“available at**:” box will become
   populated. This folder contains the disaggregated data needed to run
   the model.

**Tip:** Save time in future: If the exact same input data files are
used in a later study, then the “prepare” step can be skipped: click the
“…” button and navigate to a folder that contains the relevant
disaggregated data. It will then be copied to the new output folder and
used as normal.

Run the model for 1 week
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Choose a start date of 11 May 2015, using the start and end date boxes,
then select “Run”.

.. figure:: /images/LQF_Tutorial_DateRange.png


    ```to do```

Visualise results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the model run this is finished, press “visualise outputs” to view
some of the model results to open the visualisation tool.

.. figure:: /images/LQF_Tutorial_Visualise.png
   :alt: LQF_Tutorial_Visualise.png
   :width: 300px

   ```to do```

Create a map of total QF at noon
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the visualisation tool to create a map of all the QF components at
noon (11:00-12:00 UTC) on May 11 by selecting that time and pressing
“Add to canvas”. This may take a moment to process. Close the
visualisation tool and return to the main canvas to inspect the four new
layers that have appeared.

.. figure:: /images/525px-LQF_Tutorial_QfMap_1.png

    ```to do```

Each layer corresponds to a different QF component, Qm (metabolism) and
is plotted on the top layer. De-selecting a layer in the Layers panel
removes it from view.

Leaving just Qf (total QF) visible, there isn’t much structure in the
colours. Add some contrast to it by choosing a different colour scale.

Right-click the Qf layer, go to Properties > Style, change the colour
ramp to “Reds” and choose Mode: Natural Breaks (Jenks). This shows much
more structure, although the grid borders are distracting. These can be
removed by double-clicking the colour levels and choosing a border
colour the same as the fill colour.

.. figure:: /images/525px-LQF_Tutorial_QfMap_2.png

    ```to do```

Plot a time series of QF in the centre of the city
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A time series can be shown for any of the output areas. To identify one
of interest, zoom into the city centre, choose the selection tool

.. figure:: /images/LQF_Tutorial_SelectFeatureIcon.png


    ```to do```

and click an output area of
interest.

This turns yellow. Right-click it and select the option that comes up.

          .. figure:: /images/LQF_Tutorial_SelectFeature.png

              Information about the output area

then appears on the left, with the ID shown. Make a note of this.

    .. figure:: /images/LQF_Tutorial_FeatureInfo.png

        ```to do```

Return to the visualisation tool, choose output area 5448 and click
“show plot”. Time series of each QF component then appear for the week.
Note the lower traffic activity on Saturday and Sunday, and the higher
building emissions on Thursday 15th when the weather is colder.

    .. figure:: /images/525px-LQF_Tutorial_Temporal_standardcase.png

        ```to do```

Recycling of input data
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Ideally the model is run only for dates covered by the daily temperature
data, but the data is recycled if the model runs beyond the end of the
available temperature data. In this tutorial, only 2015 temperatures are
provided. If the model ran into 2016, a suitable date from the 2015
temperature data would be selected based on the time of year. Except at
the very start or end of the year, the date from 2015 used will be
within a few days of the same date in 2016.

Tutorials II: Refining LQF results
----------------------------------

Once a basic QF estimate has been made (as in the previous section),
there are several options to refining this using additional data that
may be available.

The following mini-tutorials show how each of these refinements are
applied, and the output of the model is compared to that of the standard
case.

Tutorial 2a: Custom diurnal profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this scenario, new diurnal profiles for building energy consumption
and road vehicle traffic are available for London. These profiles are
assumed to better represent the city than the default profiles in the
LQF database. In this example, we will re-run LQF using the new
profiles.

Each country in the LQF database is associated with two diurnal profiles
for transport (a weekend and a weekday version), and the same for
building emissions. LQF takes in a week-long profile, starting on
Monday, for transport and buildings (shown below), and different
profiles can be used for different times of year (`click here for full
information about diurnal profile
files <LQF_Manual#Diurnal_variations>`__).

      .. figure:: /images/525px-LQF_Tutorial_WeeklyTraffic.png

          Custom traffic profile

.. figure:: /images/525px-LQF_Tutorial_BuildingProfiles.png


    ```to do```

**Step 1:**
Create a duplicate of the DataSources.nml file used earlier

**Step 2:** create a new folder for the model outputs.

**Step 3:** Note the paths to the weeklyTraffic.csv and
LondonBuildingProfiles.csv files. These contain new profile data

**Step 4:** Add these to the &temporal section of the new DataSources
file using the optional diurnTraffic and diurnEnergy entries. The
section should now resemble this:

::

   &temporal
       dailyTemperature = 'C:/Some/Path/To/Files/dailyTemperature_2015.csv'
       diurnTraffic = 'C:/Some/Path/To/Files/weeklyTraffic.csv'
       diurnEnergy = 'C:/Some/Path/To/Files/LondonBuildingProfiles.csv'
   /

**Step 5:** Re-run LQF for 7 days week, starting 11 May 2015, specifying
the new DataSources file at run time. Visualising the time series for
output area 5448 again:

.. figure:: /images/525px-LQF_Tutorial_Temporal_customDiurnals.png
   :alt: LQF_Tutorial_Temporal_customDiurnals.png
   :width: 350px

    ```to do```


Note how the building and transport emission patterns now change on
different days of the week. This is especially noticeable in transport
emissions on the final 3 days of the week.

Tutorial 2b: Updating national parameters in the LQF database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LQF takes the latest national attributes (population, vehicle count and
energy consumption) up to and including the year(s) modelled. The copy
of the LQF database used in this tutorial contains national UK
population values in 2010 and 2016. This means the 2010 population is
used when 2015 is simulated. This can be updated or added to if data
becomes available. The database can be edited using software such as
SQLite Browser.

Fictional scenario: The UK population in 2015 was approximate twice that
in 2010, but energy consumption remained the same.

**Step 1:** Make a copy of the LQF database as a backup

**Step 2:** Open the LQF database in SQLite browser or other suitable
software

**Step 3:** Browse the “attributes” table, which contains national
attributes for all countries

**Step 4:** Locate the population in the UK 2010 row (the value is
62036000.0)

**Step 5:** Create a new row for the UK in 2015 with the following
entries:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Database column
     - Value
   * - id
     - United Kingdom
   * - as\_of\_year
     - 2015
   * - population
     - 120000000
   * - population\_datasource
     - Fake value for test

**Step 6:** Run the model as in the first example.

**Step 7:** Visualise the data for output area 5448. Note how the
building emissions are approximately half of those in the first example,
because the national energy consumption per-capita is now half as much.
The vehicle emissions are the same because they are specified per 10,000
people in the LQF database.

.. figure:: /images/525px-LQF_Tutorial_Temporal_customdatabase.png
   :alt: LQF_Tutorial_Temporal_customdatabase.png
   :width: 350px

    ```to do```


**Step 8: Restore the original LQF database so that the test values do
not corrupt future modelling studies**

**Tip:** To check which national values were used at a given time, check
the log folder of the model output directory: NationalParameters.txt
contains a list of the values used for each modelled year and country.
The following example shows the 2014 value of energy consumption
(kwh\_year) being looked up for model runs in 2015.

“DB value for United Kingdom kwh_year in modelled year 2015: 966862000000.0 (2014 value)”

See `the manual <LQF_Manual#Wide-area_data>`__ for a list of the
parameters stored in the LQF database.

Tutorial 2c: Custom temperature response function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building emissions are governed by a function that relates the daily
mean air temperature to energy consumption. This is a simple treatment
that may not capture the full relationship, so a custom function with
more parameters can also be used in LQF (`full
details <LQF_Manual#Temperature_response_functions>`__).

This example shows how to activate the custom temperature response
function, and how it affects the results.

The parameters of the custom function are specified using optional
entries in the `Parameters file <LQF_Manual#Parameters_file>`__. In this
example, we will assume that:

-  The use of energy stops increasing when the temperature exceeds 20C
   (weighting is 0.5)
-  Energy use increases steeply by 0.5 per degree below 20C

**Step 1:** Open the parameters.nml file

**Step 2:** Copy the optional entries needed for the custom temperature
response from the manual and ensure the values are consistent with those
below

::

     &CustomTemperatureResponse
        Th = 20
        Tc = 20
        Ah = 0.5
        Ac = 0.5
        c = 0.5
        Tmax = 50
        Tmin = -10
     /

**Step 3** : Save the parameters file and run the model as in the
original tutorial. Note how the day-to-day variations in the building
emissions are much greater than in `Tutorial
1 <#LQF_Tutorial_1:_Simple_QF_modelling>`__, but the transport and
metabolism emissions remains the same as before.
