Urban Energy Balance - SUEWS Advanved
==========================================

Introduction
------------

The tutorial :ref:`IntroductionToSuews` should be completed first. This tutorial is designed to work with QGIS 2.18.


Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~

#. To explore the link between QGIS and SUEWS to include new
   site-specific information
#. To examine how it affects the energy fluxes

Overview of steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Initially become familiar with SUEWS advanced which is a
   plugin that makes it possible for you to set all parameters that can
   be manipulated in SUEWS as well as execute the model on mutiple grids (:ref:`SuewsSpatial`).
#. Derive new surface information
#. Run the model

How to Run from the UMEP-plugin
-------------------------------

**How to run SUEWS Advanced:**

#. Open the plugin which is located at *UMEP -> Processor -> Urban Energy
   Balance -> Urban Energy Balance, SUEWS/BLUEWS (Advanced)*. This has
   most of the general settings (e.g. activate the snow module etc.)
   which are related to
   `RunControl.nml <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input_files/RunControl/RunControl.html>`__.
#. Use the Input folder:

   -  *C:/Users/your_user_name/.qgis2/python/plugins/UMEP/suewsmodel/Input*

#. Create or enter an **Output directory** of your choice.
#. From the **Input folder** - confirm the data are in there.
#. Fill in the following. File Code: should be Kc, UTC: should be 0
   (London).
#. Run
#. Make sure that output files are created.
#. You can now close the **SUEWS/BLUEWS (Advanced)**-plugin again.

Sensitivity Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default dataset included in **Suews Simple** has parameters
calculated from a `source area
model <SourceArea(Point)>`
to obtain the appropriate values for the input parameters. Roughness
parameters such as roughness length (z\ :sub:`0`) and zero plane
displacement length (z\ :sub:`d`) are calculated using `morphometric
models <MorphometricCalculator(Point)>`__.
Now you will explore the differences in fluxes using the default
settings or using input parameters from the geodata included in the test
datasets available for this tutorial. Download the zip-file (see below)
and extract the files to a suitable location where you both have reading
and writing capabilities.

Data for the tutorial can be downloaded
`here <https://github.com/Urban-Meteorology-Reading/Urban-Meteorology-Reading.github.io/tree/master/other%20files/DataSmallAreaLondon.zip>`__

.. list-table::

   * - **Geodata**
     - **Name**
   * - Ground and building DSM
     - DSM_LondonCity_1m.tif (m asl)
   * - Vegetation DSM
     - CDSM_LondonCity_1m.tif (m agl)
   * - DEM (digital elevation model)
     - DEM_LondonCity_1m.tif (masl)
   * - Land cover
     - LC_londoncity_UMEP_32631


They are all projected in UTM 31N (EPSG:32631). The three surface models
originate from a LiDAR dataset. The land cover data is a mixture of
Ordnance Survey and the LiDAR data.

#. Open the geodatasets. Go to *Layer > Add layer > Add Raster Layer*.
   Locate the files you downloaded before (see above).
#. A QGIS style file (.qml) is available for the land cover grid. It can
   found in *C:\Users\your_user_name\.qgis2\python\plugins\UMEP\\
   LandCoverReclassifier\\*. Load it in the *Layer > Properties > Style
   > Style* (lower left) **Load file**.
#. Click Apply before you close so that the names of the classes also
   load. You can also get the properties of a layer by right-click on a
   layer in the Layers-window.
#. If you have another land cover dataset you can use the
   `LandCoverReclassifier <LandCoverReclassifier>`
   in the UMEP pre-processor to populate with the correct values
   suitable for the UMEP plugin environment.
#. Now take a moment and investigate the different geodatasets. What is
   the sparial (pixel) resolution? How is ground represented in the
   CDSM?

Generating data from the geodatasets
------------------------------------

#. Make certain that you have the geodatafiles open. The file at the top
   (left hand side (LHS)) of the list is the one that is shown in the
   centre (figure below). You can swap their order using the LHS box.
#. Open SUEWS Simple.
#. Begin by adding the test dataset again.
#. Update the building morphology parameters (top left panel in Suews
   Simple).
#. To generate new values, click on Open tool.
#. This is another plugin within UMEP that can be used to generate
   morphometric parameters

      QGIS where Suews Simple and Image Morphometric Parameters (Point) is opened.

#. First, clear the map canvas from your two other plugin windows, e.g.
   as figure above.
#. If you use the default test data in SUEWS Simple - you can overwrite
   is as you go.
#. Locate the eddy covariance tower position on the Strand building,
   King's College London. To find the position, consult Figure 1 (KSS)
   in `Kotthaus and Grimmond
   (2014) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095513000503>`__.
#. Use Select point on canvas and put a point at that location (left).
#. Generate a study area. Use 500 m search distance, 5 degree interval
   and click Generate study area.
#. A circular area will be considered. Enter the DSM and DEM files (i.e.
   the files you currently have in the viewer)
#. Click Run.

      Figure 3. Settings for Image Morphometric Parameters for buildings.

#. In the folder you specified two additional files will be present (i)
   isotropic - averages of the morphometric parameters (ii) anisotropic
   - values for each wind sector you specified (5 degrees).
#. Close this plugin
#. Click on Fetch file from... in the building morphology panel
#. Choose the isotropic file (just generated).
#. Do the same for vegetation (upper left panel, right).
#. Instead of locating the point again you can use the existing point.
#. You still need to generate a separate study area for the vegetation
   calculation.
#. Examine the CDSM (vegetation file) in your map canvas. As you can
   see, this data has no ground heights (ground = 0). Therefore, this
   time Tick in the box Raster DSM (only buildings) exist.
#. Enter the CDSM as your Raster DSM (only buildings).

   .. figure:: /images/SUEWSAdvanced_SUEWS_MorphometricParametersVeg.png
      :alt:  None
      :scale: 75%

      Settings for Image Morphometric Parameters for vegetation

#. A warning appears that your vegetation fractions between the
   morphology dataset and land cover dataset are large. You can ignore
   this for now since the land cover dataset also will change.
#. Repeat the same procedure for land cover using the Land Cover
   Fraction (Point) plugin.
#. Enter the meteorological file, Year etc. This should be the same as
   for the first run you made.
#. Now you are ready to run the model. Click Run.

If you get an error window (figure below). This error is generate by SUEWS as the sum
of the land cover fractions is not 1. If you calculate carefully, one
part of a thousand is missing (this is probably a rounding error during
data extraction). To fix this issue: add 0.001 to e.g. bare soil. Now
run again.

You are now familiar with the Suews Simple plugin. Your next task is to
choose another location within the geodataset domain, generate data and
run the model. If you choose an area where the fraction of buildings and
paved surfaces are low, consider lowering the population density to get
more realistic model outputs. Compare the results for the different
area.

Morphometric Methods to determine Roughness parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more and overview and details see `Grimmond and Oke
(1999) <http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0450(1999)038%3C1262%3AAPOUAD%3E2.0.CO%3B2>`__.
This uses the height and spacing of roughness elements (e.g. buildings,
trees) to model the roughness parameters. UMEP has tools for doing this:
*Pre-processor -> Urban Morphology*

Source Area Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more details see Kotthaus and Grimmond (2014b). The Kormann and
Meixner (2001) model is used to determine the probable area that a
turbulent flux measurement was impacted by. This is a function of wind
direction, stability, turbulence characteristics (friction velocity,
variance of the lateral wind velocity) and roughness parameters.
